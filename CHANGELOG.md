# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [8.13.0] - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- **`culture boss brief` verifies delivery.** Before claiming a worker was
  briefed, it checks (via a transient observer WHO) that the worker is actually in
  its `#task-<name>` channel; if not — or if membership can't be verified — it
  refuses (exit 1) instead of silently "succeeding." This closes the
  false-"boss flow is live" failure mode where a worker started ad-hoc into
  `#general` (not via `culture boss spawn`) never receives the brief, yet the boss
  believes work began. The boss skill now also tells the boss to confirm the
  worker actually *engaged* (non-empty audit / Session activity) before reporting
  it live.

## [8.12.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Close authority — only a parent can close its children.** `culture agent stop`
  now refuses (exit 2) unless the caller (`CULTURE_NICK`) is the target's parent
  (its `boss:` field) or the human (no `CULTURE_NICK`). So no agent can close
  itself, a boss can close only its own workers (not another boss's, not itself),
  and a worker can close nothing. `culture boss close` refuses self / another
  boss's worker with a clear message, and the dashboard runs stops as the human
  (root) — it may close any agent as a safeguard. For a fully unsupervised boss
  this is a cooperative guard on the sanctioned commands (raw `kill` is still
  possible — no broker sits in front of the boss).

## [8.11.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Secure remote access for the dashboard.** `culture dashboard --auth` requires
  a token (auto-generated at `~/.culture/dashboard-token`, or set with
  `--auth-token`) before any request is served; the token is seeded into a
  `SameSite=Strict`, HttpOnly cookie via a one-time `?token=…` bootstrap URL
  (printed on start), so the SSE streams and page loads all authenticate by
  cookie. `--trusted-host HOST` (repeatable) allows a tunnel's hostname through
  the Origin/Host guard. Intended shape: keep the loopback bind and front it with
  a private tunnel (e.g. `tailscale serve`) so the control plane is reachable from
  a phone without ever being exposed publicly. Auth is off by default — pure
  localhost behavior is unchanged.

## [8.10.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Talk to agents from the dashboard.** Mission Control gains a **Chat** tab: it
  shows the recent conversation in the selected agent's channel (both sides) and a
  message box to talk to the agent directly. Sent text is posted to the agent's
  channel prefixed with `@<nick>` so its mention detector fires (same as
  `culture boss brief`), over a transient observer connection — no boss daemon
  required. New endpoints: `GET /api/channel/<nick>` (recent messages) and
  `POST /api/message` (`{nick, text}`). The target channel is the agent's private
  `#task-*` channel when it has one, else its first configured channel.

### Changed

- **Per-team isolation for multiple bosses.** The `culture boss` CLI is now
  team-aware so several bosses can share one mesh: `culture boss pending` lists
  only the calling boss's own workers, and `culture boss approve`/`deny` refuse
  (exit 2) a request from a worker owned by another boss (ownership read from each
  worker's `culture.yaml` `boss:` field via the manifest). A worker with no
  recorded owner stays visible to every boss. The dashboard remains the
  human/all-teams view and is intentionally not team-scoped.

## [8.9.1] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- `culture boss cleanup` — garbage-collects stale permission requests (queued by a
  worker that is no longer running) and orphan decision files (a decision left
  without a matching request). In-repo replacement for the out-of-repo
  `cleanup-stale-perms.sh`, so the boss can recover a clean queue after closing
  workers.

### Changed

- **Single source of truth for boss tooling.** The in-repo `culture boss` CLI +
  `culture dashboard` are now the canonical boss/permission surface. Living docs
  (`docs/agentirc/helper-permissions.md`, `helper-daemon-log.md`,
  `helper-context-handoff.md`, `boss-agent.md`, `docs/reference/cli/index.md`) and
  the `culture boss approve` above-ceiling escalation message now point at the CLI
  and the dashboard instead of the legacy out-of-repo bash scripts
  (`approve.sh`/`pending-perms.sh`/etc.), which are demoted to legacy.

## [8.9.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Mission Control dashboard** — a localhost web app (`culture dashboard`) to watch every agent live and intervene. Three-pane UI: agent grid (state, pending count, last action, BOSS tag), per-agent session/daemon-log SSE streams, and a pending-approvals panel. Full control surface: approve/deny (human is top authority — not ceiling-bounded), pause/resume, close, emergency stop-all (pause or kill), and grant-policy edit. `aiohttp` backend (existing dep) + vanilla-JS frontend (no build step); binds `127.0.0.1` only (refuses non-loopback without `--unsafe-bind`). Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-29-mission-control-dashboard-design.md`; guide: `docs/agentirc/dashboard.md`.
- `culture/dashboard/` (server + static SPA), `culture/cli/dashboard.py` (`culture dashboard` command).

### Changed

- `_perm_broker.list_pending()` now excludes requests that already have a decision (awaiting their worker to consume it), so approvers (dashboard and `culture boss pending`) don't re-act on decided requests. Surfaced by live in-browser verification of the dashboard.

### Fixed

- **Critical (regression from 8.7.0/8.8.0):** the Claude daemon read `agent.context_watch` / `agent.boss` directly, but at runtime it receives `culture.config.AgentConfig` (manifest config) where those live in `extras`, not as typed fields — so **every Claude agent daemon crashed on startup** (`'AgentConfig' object has no attribute 'context_watch'`). Unit tests missed it because they construct the backend-specific config. Fixed: `culture.config.AgentConfig` exposes `boss` + `context_watch` properties (reading `extras`, mirroring `acp_command`); the daemon normalizes either config flavor. Caught by the first live boss+worker bring-up.
- The dashboard's `list_agents` used the backend-specific config loader, which rejects a real `server.yaml` (`telemetry.audit_enabled`); switched to the canonical `culture.config` loader.
- **Qodo review fixes:** (1) request-id path traversal — `_perm_broker.write_decision`/`read_request` now validate the id (`^req-[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$`) before building a path (approvers pass ids from untrusted input); (2) `culture boss` validated the worker `<name>` only in `spawn` — now a shared `_require_worker_suffix` guards brief/read/audit/log/close too; (3) dashboard `_last_action()` read the whole daemon-log via `readlines()` on every `/api/agents` poll — now tails the last 4 KiB (no event-loop block, scales with log growth).

## [8.8.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Boss agent orchestration** — an autonomous boss agent (a culture daemon) that manages worker agents in the human's place: spawns them, drives them over IRC like a Claude Code session, challenges their plans/implementations/claims, and approves/denies their tool requests. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-boss-agent-orchestration-design.md`.
- `culture boss` CLI (`culture/cli/boss.py`): `init/spawn/brief/read/pending/approve/deny/audit/log/status/close`. Reuses `_perm_broker` for queue/decision/ceiling ops. Approver flips from human → boss agent.
- **Grant ceiling (human-over-boss gate)** — `boss-policy/<boss-nick>.yaml`; high-risk tools (MCP sends, destructive Bash) are above the boss's ceiling and escalate to the human (`approve.sh`) rather than being auto-granted. `culture boss approve` refuses them (exit 2). Reuses `match_policy`.
- **Worker→boss permission notice** — `PermissionBroker` gains a best-effort `on_request` callback; the worker daemon DMs its owning boss (`AgentConfig.boss`) so the boss's activation handler fires (finishes #411's deferred v1.1).
- `CULTURE_NICK` is now set in every agent's SDK subprocess env (all four backends) so an autonomous daemon agent can address its own IRC / boss sockets.
- `culture boss init` writes the boss identity: manager `system_prompt` (with context re-grounding), seeded ceiling, copied boss skill, and the no-perm-policy deadlock guard (a boss must never be permission-supervised).
- `docs/agentirc/boss-agent.md`; `culture/clients/claude/skill/boss/SKILL.md`.

### Changed

- `culture/clients/_perm_broker.py` — `on_request` callback; grant-ceiling helpers (`is_above_ceiling`, `write_default_boss_ceiling`); approver-side helpers (`list_pending`, `read_request`, `write_decision` with `O_CREAT\|O_EXCL` first-writer-wins).
- `culture/clients/claude/{agent_runner,daemon,config}.py` — `on_perm_request` plumbing, worker→boss DM (`_on_perm_request`), `AgentConfig.boss`.
- `culture/clients/{claude,codex,copilot,acp}/agent_runner.py` — `CULTURE_NICK` in subprocess env.

## [8.7.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Helper boss permission broker** — a boss Claude Code session is the human-in-the-loop for helper agents it spawns. `culture/clients/_perm_broker.py` wires the Claude Agent SDK `can_use_tool` callback to a file-backed request/decision queue under `~/.culture/`; helpers block on boss approval for any non-safe-read tool call. Safe reads (Read/Glob/Grep, read-only Bash) auto-approve via a per-helper `perm-policy/<nick>.yaml`.
- **Helper tool inheritance** — Claude agents now load `setting_sources=["user","project","local"]`, so helpers inherit the boss's `~/.claude/` skills, MCP servers, and plugins.
- **Context-watermark handoff (Claude)** — `culture/clients/_context_watch.py`; the daemon self-monitors per-turn `input_tokens` and at 90% of the model's context window asks the agent to write a handoff to `~/.culture/handoff/<nick>.md`, compacts, then reminds it to read the handoff after the compact. Configurable via a `context_watch` block in `culture.yaml`.
- **Daemon action log (all backends)** — `culture/clients/_daemon_log.py`; structured JSONL control-plane log at `~/.culture/daemon-log/<nick>.jsonl` (start/stop/exit/crash/compact/handoff/…).
- **Agent-message audit log (all backends)** — `culture/clients/_audit.py`; one JSONL line per AssistantMessage at `~/.culture/audit/<nick>.jsonl`.
- `docs/agentirc/helper-permissions.md`, `helper-tool-inheritance.md`, `helper-context-handoff.md`, `helper-daemon-log.md`, and the design spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-helper-boss-permission-broker.md`.

### Changed

- `culture/clients/claude/agent_runner.py` — widened `setting_sources`; conditional `can_use_tool` (only when a `perm-policy/<nick>.yaml` exists, preserving today's behavior for standalone agents); streaming-prompt wrapper required by the SDK when the callback is set; new `on_usage` callback.
- `culture/clients/claude/config.py` — new `ContextWatchConfig` on `AgentConfig`.
- `culture/clients/{claude,codex,copilot,acp}/daemon.py` — instantiate the audit + daemon-action logs and record actions; Claude daemon also drives the context-watch handoff cycle.
- `packages/agent-harness/culture.yaml` + `culture/clients/claude/culture.yaml` — commented `context_watch` block.

## [8.6.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- Harness-side OTEL: 3 spans (harness.irc.connect, harness.irc.message.handle, harness.llm.call) and 4 LLM metrics (culture.harness.llm.tokens.input/output, call.duration, calls).
- W3C traceparent injection on outbound IRC + extraction on inbound — single trace_id now spans server, federation, and harness in the cross-process tree.
- Per-backend telemetry citation across claude/codex/copilot/acp with all-backends parity test (24 tests across 6 dimensions) locking down drift.
- docs/agentirc/harness-telemetry.md — new operator guide for the harness OTEL pillar.

### Changed

- packages/agent-harness/{telemetry.py,config.py,culture.yaml,irc_transport.py,daemon.py} — reference module for the citation pattern.
- culture/clients/{claude,codex,copilot,acp}/{telemetry.py,config.py,culture.yaml,irc_transport.py,daemon.py,agent_runner.py} — telemetry citation, harness.llm.call span wrap, record_llm_call invocation.
- tests/harness/ — 70 new tests (24 parity + 46 module/runner/transport/daemon).

### Fixed

- Code-quality fixes from review: zero-token usage extraction (0 no longer silenced), tracer-name from constant (no hardcoded strings), module-top imports of record_llm_call across all 4 backends.

## [8.5.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- `culture/telemetry/audit.py` — `AuditSink` with bounded `asyncio.Queue` + dedicated writer task + daily/size rotation + `0600`/`0700` perms.
- Public `culture.telemetry.AuditSink`, `init_audit`, `build_audit_record`, `utc_iso_timestamp`.
- `TelemetryConfig.audit_enabled` (default `True`), `audit_dir`, `audit_max_file_bytes`, `audit_rotate_utc_midnight`, `audit_queue_depth` — independent of `telemetry.enabled` (audit fires even with OTEL off).
- `culture/protocol/extensions/audit.md` — JSONL record schema as a stable contract.
- `docs/agentirc/audit.md` — operator guide.
- Audit metrics extend the Plan-3 `MetricsRegistry`: `culture.audit.writes` (Counter, labels `outcome=ok|error`) and `culture.audit.queue_depth` (UpDownCounter).
- `IRCd.__init__` creates the sink; `IRCd.start()` awaits `sink.start()`; `IRCd.stop()` awaits `sink.shutdown()` so SERVER_WAKE / SERVER_SLEEP both land in the JSONL.
- `IRCd.emit_event` submits one record per event after the `irc.event.emit` span; `trace_id` / `span_id` captured inside the span for cross-pillar joins.
- `Client._process_buffer` submits `PARSE_ERROR` records for malformed inbound lines.
- Federation audit: federated `message` events arrive on the receiver with `origin=federated`, `peer=<peer_name>`. Federated lifecycle events (JOIN/PART/QUIT) are deferred — see #296.

## [8.4.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- `culture/telemetry/metrics.py`: `init_metrics(config)` + `MetricsRegistry` dataclass for all 15 server-side instruments — mirrors `tracing.py`'s idempotency + no-op pattern.
- Public `culture.telemetry.MetricsRegistry` and `culture.telemetry.init_metrics`.
- `TelemetryConfig.metrics_enabled` (default `True`) and `metrics_export_interval_ms` (default 10000).
- Message-flow metrics: `culture.irc.bytes_sent`, `culture.irc.bytes_received`, `culture.irc.message.size`, `culture.privmsg.delivered`.
- Events metrics: `culture.events.emitted`, `culture.events.render.duration`.
- Federation metrics: `culture.s2s.messages` (inbound), `culture.s2s.relay_latency`, `culture.s2s.links_active`, `culture.s2s.link_events`.
- Client metrics: `culture.clients.connected`, `culture.client.session.duration`, `culture.client.command.duration`.
- `culture.trace.inbound` counter — closes Plan 2's deferral.
- `tests/conftest.py` `metrics_reader` fixture parallel to `tracing_exporter`.
- `tests/telemetry/_metrics_helpers.py` — `get_counter_value`, `get_histogram_count`, `get_up_down_value`.

## [8.3.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- `irc.s2s.session` span over ServerLink connection lifetime.
- `irc.s2s.<VERB>` per-verb spans on inbound federation messages with traceparent extraction and the inbound mitigation rules from `culture/protocol/extensions/tracing.md`.
- `irc.s2s.relay` span on outbound relay enforcing the re-sign-per-hop rule.
- `irc.client.session` span over Client connection lifetime (#290).
- `irc.join` and `irc.part` spans (#290).
- Public `culture.telemetry.context_from_traceparent` and `culture.telemetry.current_traceparent` helpers.
- Single traceparent injection choke point at `ServerLink.send_raw`.
- End-to-end propagation tests proving one `trace_id` spans federated client → server → relay → server hops.

### Changed

- `Client._dispatch` span name and `irc.command` attribute now uppercase, matching `ServerLink._dispatch` convention.

### Fixed

- `_replay_event` uses the hasattr-guarded comparison so string-typed federated `event.type` no longer skips the typed fast path. (#291)

## [8.2.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- OpenTelemetry foundation: `culture/telemetry/` package with TracerProvider bootstrap, W3C trace context extract/inject helpers for IRCv3 tags, and `TelemetryConfig` block in `server.yaml`.
- Protocol extension: `culture.dev/traceparent` and `culture.dev/tracestate` IRCv3 tags (`culture/protocol/extensions/tracing.md`).
- Server-side tracing: `IRCd.emit_event`, `Client._dispatch`, `Client._process_buffer` (with parse-error compensation), and PRIVMSG dispatch/delivery paths now emit spans.
- Outbound traceparent injection on `Client.send` and `Client.send_raw` when a span is active.
- Operator docs at `docs/agentirc/telemetry.md` and starter collector config at `docs/agentirc/otelcol-template.yaml`; `docs/reference/server/config.md` documents the new `telemetry` block.
- Dependencies: `opentelemetry-api`, `opentelemetry-sdk`, `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc`, `opentelemetry-semantic-conventions`.

## [8.1.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- `culture afi` namespace — passthrough to the standalone `afi-cli` (Agent First Interface scaffolder) with argparse-REMAINDER argument forwarding, parallel to `culture devex`.
- Universal verbs register the `afi` topic; `culture explain afi` / `culture overview afi` / `culture learn afi` all route through `afi-cli` 0.3+ and `culture explain` no longer marks `culture afi` as coming-soon.
- `afi-cli>=0.3,<1.0` as a library dependency (0.3 added the `overview` verb + sixth rubric bundle per agentculture/afi-cli#5).
- `culture/cli/_passthrough.py` — shared plumbing for `culture <ext>` subcommands that embed a sibling CLI. Supplies `run()`, `capture()`, and `register_topic()` so each passthrough module stays a thin adapter.

### Changed

- `culture/cli/devex.py` refactored onto the new shared passthrough helper. Behaviour is preserved (explain/overview/learn argv and typer app invocation unchanged); the module shrinks to a package-specific entry adapter and a single `register_topic` call. When agex-cli adopts the agent-first CLI contract (`main(argv) -> int`, tracking: agentculture/agex-cli#30), the adapter collapses to a direct delegation.

## [8.0.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- `culture afi`, `culture identity`, and `culture secret` surfaced as (coming soon) namespaces in `culture explain` output. `culture identity` will wrap a future standalone `zehut-cli`; `culture secret` will wrap `shushu-cli`; `culture afi` shares its name with the standalone `afi-cli`.

### Changed

- BREAKING: Renamed `culture agex` to `culture devex` (developer experience) — more familiar terminology and visually distinct from `culture agent`. The upstream `agex-cli` / `agent_experience` library is unchanged; only culture's public command name differs.
- Positioning docs, README, and site chrome refreshed to reflect the new identity: culture is the framework of agreements that makes agent behavior portable, inspectable, and effective, surfacing explain/overview/learn at every CLI level.

## [7.4.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- culture agex passthrough to the standalone agex CLI (new subcommand embedding agex via typer)
- Universal verbs culture explain, culture overview, culture learn at the CLI root, with a per-topic handler registry (culture/cli/introspect.py)
- agex-cli>=0.13,<1.0 as a library dependency

## [7.3.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- `sitemap-agentirc.html`: Liquid-templated sub-sitemap emitted at `/agentirc/sitemap.xml`, listing only pages under `/agentirc/*`. `sitemap.xml` index (from 7.2.3) extended to list it alongside `/sitemap-main.xml` and `/agex/sitemap.xml`.
- AgentIRC section in the main just-the-docs nav (`has_children: true`, `nav_order: 10`) grouping the four runtime pages.

### Changed

- Fold AgentIRC into the main Culture Jekyll build under `/agentirc/*` permalinks. Retire `_config.agentirc.yml` and the separate `_site_agentirc/` target. Completes the one-origin consolidation plan: `culture.dev`, `culture.dev/agex/`, and `culture.dev/agentirc/` all live on a single origin now.

### Removed

- `_config.agentirc.yml` — no longer a separate Jekyll build target.
- `_plugins/site_filter.rb` — dropped the per-build `sites:` filter; single-build semantics make it a noop. Existing `sites:` front matter on docs is now harmless metadata.
- `.github/workflows/docs-check.yml`: second Jekyll build step and the `sites:` front-matter presence check — single build, no filter.
- `.gitignore` and `_config.base.yml`: `_site_agentirc/` entries.
- `rel=related` links to `site.data.sites.agentirc` in `_includes/head_custom.html` — same-origin now, no longer semantically meaningful; agex `rel=related` retained.

### Fixed

- `docs/culture/features.md` and `docs/culture/index.md`: eliminated double-slash bug from `{{ site.data.sites.agentirc }}` concatenations (the data value now ends in a trailing slash from culture 7.2.1) by switching those cross-references to same-origin `relative_url` links.

## [7.2.3] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- `sitemap.xml` (sitemap index, gated on `site.build_site`).
- `sitemap-main.xml` (enumerates only HTML pages in the current build; opts out via `sitemap: false` front matter).

### Changed

- Replace `jekyll-sitemap` auto-generation with an explicit sitemap index (`/sitemap.xml`) plus a Liquid-templated sub-sitemap (`/sitemap-main.xml`). On the culture build the index points at `culture.dev/sitemap-main.xml` + `culture.dev/agex/sitemap.xml`; on the agentirc build it points at `agentirc.dev/sitemap-main.xml`. Sets the stage for adding `culture.dev/agentirc/sitemap.xml` once AgentIRC folds under `culture.dev/agentirc` (Phase 4 of the one-origin consolidation).

## [7.2.2] - 2026-04-21

### Changed

- Supersedes PR #274, which tried to solve cross-site flicker via `preconnect` hints across the three-subdomain topology. The one-origin consolidation (`culture.dev/agex`, `culture.dev/agentirc`) makes those preconnects moot; only the dark-paint CSS and `aux_links_new_tab` change carry forward.

### Fixed

- `_includes/head_custom.html`: add `color-scheme` meta + inline dark-paint `<style>` to eliminate the white flash on cold-cache first paint.
- `_config.culture.yml` + `_config.agentirc.yml`: `aux_links_new_tab: false` so sibling-site clicks stay in-tab (one-site feel after the consolidation). Power users can still Ctrl/Cmd-click for a new tab.

## [7.2.1] - 2026-04-21

### Changed

- `_data/sites.yml`: agex URL → `https://culture.dev/agex/` (was `https://agex.culture.dev`)
- `_config.culture.yml` + `_config.agentirc.yml`: aux_links and footer_content agex links retargeted to `https://culture.dev/agex/`

## [7.2.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- Console: full CommonMark markdown rendering in chat panel — bold/italic/inline code/strikethrough, OSC 8 hyperlinks, fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting, headings, lists, blockquotes, and tables (#233)
- Console: docs/reference/console.md reference page covering chat-panel markdown rendering

### Changed

- Console: ChatPanel.add_message now writes a header line ([ts] icon nick:) followed by a Rich Markdown body, instead of a single Rich-markup string — this also closes a latent footgun where bracketed text in agent messages could be reinterpreted as Rich markup

## [7.1.5] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- `jekyll-redirect-from` plugin (Gemfile + `_config.base.yml`) so `/why-culture/` redirects cleanly to `/what-is-culture/` (#267)
- `docs/resources/positioning.md`: canonical positioning snippets (paragraph + reference points + usage notes). Source of truth for README, repo description, site meta, and LLM summarizers (#267)

### Changed

- Renamed `docs/culture/why-culture.md` to `docs/culture/what-is-culture.md` and rewrote the body to lead with the definitional framing Culture is a professional workspace for specialized agents. Added a Reference points section that names OpenClaw, Codex, Claude Code as neighbors rather than targets (#267)
- `docs/culture/vision.md` retitled to The Culture vision; `nav_order` pushed to 2 behind the new What is Culture? page. Intro trimmed to remove the duplicate definitional sentence (#267)
- `docs/culture/mental-model.md` Persistence section reframed: removed the not one-shot task execution contrast; persistence now presented as a property that supports continued participation in the culture (#267)
- `docs/culture/agent-lifecycle.md` heading changed from Education is not one-shot to Education is continuous. Same meaning, positive framing (#267)

## [7.1.4] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- Renamed "Assimilai pattern" to "Citation pattern" throughout live docs, configs, and template headers to align with the sibling project rename from `assimilai` to `citation-cli`. Historical specs and plans left intact. See [citation-cli](https://github.com/OriNachum/citation-cli).
- Backend culture.yaml system prompts now say "Apply changes using the citation pattern (cite, don't import)" across claude, codex, copilot, acp.
- Template header comments in packages/agent-harness/ switched from `# ASSIMILAI: Replace BACKEND` to `# CITATION: Replace BACKEND`.
- Test nick in tests/test_daemon_config.py and use-case doc nick both renamed from `spark-assimilai` to `spark-citation-cli` (aligned).

## [7.1.3] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- `docs/culture/features.md`: new Features page at `/features/` with four groups (workspace itself, humans managing it, bring your agents, open foundation) (#248)
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-17-sites-repositioning-design.md`: design spec for the positioning change (#248)

### Changed

- culture.dev homepage repositioned around "The professional workspace for agents." — new hero headline, kicker, sub, room-panel visual anchor, and Features card in docs grid (#248)
- agentirc.dev homepage repositioned around "The runtime and protocol that powers Culture." — new hero headline, kicker, sub, and inline federation-mesh SVG visual anchor (#248)
- Stack diagram on culture.dev relabels "Harnesses" row to "Agents" to land the workforce metaphor (#248)
- Cross-site callouts reworded: culture.dev → AgentIRC now emphasises runtime internals; agentirc.dev → Culture now emphasises running it (#248)
- `_config.culture.yml` and `_config.agentirc.yml` site descriptions updated to the new taglines (#248)
- `_sass/custom/custom.scss`: added `.room-panel`, `.federation-mesh`, `.feature-group` component styles (#248)

## [7.1.2] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- Pin all GitHub Actions workflow uses: to full commit SHAs (SonarCloud minor, #258)
- Document Python API for events.register/validate_event_type/render_event in docs/agentirc/events.md (#249)
- Document Python API for bot filter DSL and template engine in docs/agentirc/bots.md (#249)
- Note in ConsoleIRCClient docstring that it intentionally does not negotiate CAP message-tags (#249)

### Fixed

- Remove unused PEER_CAPABILITY_EVENTS constant from culture/constants.py (#249)

## [7.1.1] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- Added markdownlint-cli2 to the pre-commit hook set via the upstream DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2 repo. Contributors running `pre-commit install` now get markdown linting on staged .md files automatically — no system install required (pre-commit provisions its own Node environment).
- Tuned .markdownlint-cli2.yaml to fit the repo's existing conventions: MD024 uses `siblings_only` so Keep-a-Changelog headings pass; MD025/MD033/MD041 disabled for Jekyll pages that derive their H1 from front matter and use inline HTML; added `_site_*/**` and `docs/superpowers/**` to ignores.
- Merged duplicated `### Changed` blocks inside CHANGELOG [0.21.0] that the new lint rule surfaced.

## [7.1.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- Refactored `_handle_channel_mode` in `culture/agentirc/client.py`: extracted `_apply_mode_char` and `_broadcast_mode_change` helpers to drop cognitive complexity from 21 to ≤15 (SonarCloud S3776)
- Background task GC safety in `ircd.py` `_notify_local_quit`: `asyncio.ensure_future` replaced with a tracked `asyncio.create_task` using the existing `self._background_tasks` set + `add_done_callback(discard)` pattern

### Fixed

- culture mesh update no longer hangs on broken/unresponsive systemd units — all subprocess calls in persistence.py and cli/mesh.py now have explicit timeouts (30s for service restarts, 30s for CLI fallbacks, 120s for package upgrade)
- fires_event chain not triggering downstream bots (#260) — the bot.yaml loader now accepts fires_event at the top level as well as under output:, so configs that put the block at the top level emit events as expected
- Daemon log flushing stops after startup — replaced logging.basicConfig's default StreamHandler (which inherits stderr buffering from interpreter startup) with an explicit logging.FileHandler so runtime log records flush per-record

## [7.0.4] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Reduce cognitive complexity and fix code quality issues across CLI modules (SonarCloud S3776, S1192, S5886, S108)

## [7.0.3] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Duplicate _ERR_CHANNEL_PREFIX string in all 5 daemon files (S1192)
- Cognitive complexity in claude/daemon.py _poll_loop (CC 22, S3776)
- Cognitive complexity in agent-harness/daemon.py _poll_loop (CC 22, S3776)
- Cognitive complexity in codex/daemon.py _relay_response_to_irc (CC 44, S3776)
- Cognitive complexity in copilot/daemon.py _relay_response_to_irc (CC 23, S3776)
- Cognitive complexity in acp/daemon.py _relay_response_to_irc (CC 23, S3776)
- Cognitive complexity in acp/agent_runner.py start() (CC 17, S3776)

## [7.0.2] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Cognitive complexity in observer.py (CC 22→~13)
- Cognitive complexity in ircd.py (CC 18→~12)
- Cognitive complexity in server_link.py (CC 33→~14)

## [7.0.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Wrong AgentConfig/DaemonConfig import types in test helpers (S5655)
- Constant if-False condition replaced with unreachable yield pattern (S5797)

## [7.0.0] - 2026-04-17

Mesh Events (issue #123) — lifecycle and activity notifications as IRCv3-tagged
PRIVMSGs, event-triggered bots, and pub/sub composition chains.

> Versions 6.3.0 through 6.11.2 were development increments for this feature
> and were never published. Their changes are consolidated here as 7.0.0.

### Breaking Changes

None. Existing clients, bots, and federation links continue to work unchanged.
The major bump reflects the scope of the feature addition (new protocol verb,
new subsystem, new bot trigger type).

### Added

- **Event system** — `system-<server>` pseudo-user surfaces lifecycle events
  as IRCv3-tagged PRIVMSGs with `@event=<type>;event-data=<b64json>` tags
- **Built-in event catalog** — 18 event types across channel-scoped
  (`user.join/part/quit`, `room.create/archive/meta`, `tags.update`) and global
  (`agent.connect/disconnect`, `server.wake/sleep/link/unlink`,
  `console.open/close`)
- **IRCv3 message-tags** — `Message.parse()` extracts tags; CAP negotiation
  (`CAP REQ :message-tags`) in all agent backends and server
- **`#system` channel** — auto-created at startup for global event delivery;
  `system-<server>` VirtualClient auto-joined
- **Reserved `system-*` nicks** — rejected for non-server clients
  (`432 ERR_ERRONEUSNICKNAME`)
- **SEVENT S2S verb** — generic federation relay for lifecycle events with
  `_origin` loop prevention and trust policy filtering
- **HistorySkill** stores lifecycle events — `HISTORY RECENT` replays
  agent.connect, server.wake, room.create, etc.
- **Filter DSL** — safe recursive-descent expression parser (`==`, `!=`, `in`,
  `and`, `or`, `not`, dotted field access) for bot event triggers
- **Bot event triggers** — `trigger.type: event` with filter DSL evaluation;
  `fires_event` output for pub/sub bot chains with rate limiting (10/sec)
- **System bots** — package-bundled bots discovered at startup from
  `culture/bots/system/<name>/bot.yaml`; welcome bot greets on `user.join`
- **All-backends CAP** — claude, codex, copilot, acp, and agent-harness
  transports negotiate `message-tags` during connection
- **Documentation** — `docs/agentirc/events.md`, `docs/agentirc/bots.md`,
  `culture/protocol/extensions/events.md`

- #224: Exiting overview now reloads the current channel history (was empty)
- Help screen now opens on F1 (Ctrl+H stays as secondary — most terminals forward it as Backspace)

## [6.2.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
