## [9.1.9] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed — E2E harness exposes IRCd ACL CULTURE_HOME leak (the load-bearing fix)

The earlier 9.1.5–9.1.8 patches each claimed to close "no session has
gotten past brief" (per the Plenty dogfood), but none of them did —
they were all verified by unit tests that never exercised the actual
failure path. A first-pass E2E harness on this branch (real IRCd in
pytest's process + real `culture bridge` subprocess + fake TCP worker
+ real `culture boss brief` subprocess) reproduced the failure and
traced it back to ``culture/agentirc/client.py::_load_owner_map`` —
which resolves the manifest via ``culture_home()`` (env-derived). The
in-process IRCd was reading the operator's REAL
``~/.culture/server.yaml`` rather than the test sandbox, and 432-
rejecting every test JOIN to ``#task-<suffix>``.

`tests/e2e/conftest.py`'s ``e2e_ircd`` fixture now binds
``CULTURE_HOME`` / ``HOME`` / ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` on the pytest
process via ``monkeypatch.setenv`` (not just on subprocess env), and
flushes the module-level owner_map / role_map caches at fixture entry
+ exit. ``register_fake_worker`` also invalidates the ACL cache after
manifest mutation so tests don't hit the 5s TTL with stale data.

### Added — E2E test harness with 7 load-bearing tests

`tests/e2e/`:

- `test_brief_happy_path.py` — full brief delivery on the wire.
- `test_multi_worker_isolation.py` — no cross-talk between workers.
- `test_foreign_boss_refused.py` — team-isolation invariant (×2).
- `test_archive_unarchive_ownership.py` — Plenty BUG 2 reproduction:
  with consistent server prefix, archive→unarchive preserves
  ownership (validates BUG 2 was downstream of BUG 1).
- `test_server_name_drift.py` — Plenty BUG 1 contract: drifted
  ``server.name`` fails loud at the bridge (v9.1.7 fail-loud) (×2).

Real `~/.culture/server.yaml` md5 verified unchanged across the full
suite — no test pollution into the operator's manifest.

### Fixed — misleading `culture boss brief` error string

`culture/cli/boss.py::_cmd_brief` was collapsing two distinct error
paths ("IPC connect failed" and "IPC connected but the bridge replied
ok=False") into the single message "the boss daemon is not reachable
over IPC", which sent operators to the wrong remediation. The
bridge's actual error text (typically "Not joined to <channel>") is
now surfaced.

## [9.1.8] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed — BUG 1a (Plenty dogfood): agent-create silently overwrote server.name

v9.1.7 surfaced drift correctly + shipped the migrate-prefix
recovery verb. The Plenty ship-night dogfood
(`docs/v9.1.7-plenty-session-dogfood-findings.md`) found drift was
still being **introduced** by `culture agent create --server X`,
which silently overwrote `server.name` in `server.yaml` whenever
`X` disagreed with the current value. `culture boss spawn`
(including the SessionStart hook's auto-spawn) always passes
`--server <prefix>` derived from CULTURE_NICK, so a CC session
boss named `plenty-ai-guide-mobile` (prefix `plenty`) running
against an IRCd started `--name local` would rewrite
`server.name = plenty` on every spawn. The drift then propagated
to every observer + bridge.

v9.1.8 closes the introduction path with a **single-writer rule**:
only `culture server rename` may change `server.name` after
`server.yaml` exists. `agent create`:

1. Captures `server.yaml`'s pre-existence at the top of the handler
   (so `add_to_manifest`'s side-effect file creation doesn't mask
   the drift check).
2. Refuses with a clear error pointing at `culture server rename`
   when the file pre-existed and the operator passed `--server X`
   != current name.
3. Preserves first-time install ergonomics: when the file did NOT
   pre-exist, `--server X` initializes `server.name=X`.

### BUG 2 (archive→unarchive ownership) — downstream of BUG 1a

Same root cause: drifted CULTURE_NICK prefix vs workers' stored
`boss:` field. v9.1.8 prevents introduction. The cure
(`culture server migrate-prefix`, v9.1.6) remains the path for
operators already in a drifted state.

### Tests

- `test_spawn_with_drifted_server_prefix_fails_loud` — pre-creates
  server.yaml with name=local, spawns --server plenty, asserts
  refusal + bit-for-bit unchanged file.
- `test_spawn_first_time_install_writes_server_name` — clean home,
  --server X initializes server.name=X.
- 249/249 across affected suites.

### Docs

- `docs/server-name-drift-recovery.md` extended with v9.1.8
  prevention section + BUG 2 connection.

## [9.1.7] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed — server.name drift root cause: observer auto-recovers, bridges fail loud

v9.1.6 surfaced server.name drift honestly to operators but didn't
auto-recover. The other agent reproduced the bug in their plenty-
ai-guide-mobile project and asked for the root fix. This release
splits the recovery story by transport lifecycle:

**Observer (ephemeral, CLI-shaped)** — auto-recovers. When the IRCd
rejects the first attempt with canonical `432 Nickname must start
with <expected>-`, the observer parses `<expected>` from the reply,
mints a corrected temp nick under that prefix, opens a FRESH TCP
connection, retries once, logs ONE warning naming the actionable
migration command. Connection-local effective prefix —
`self.server_name` is NOT mutated, stays congruent with what's on
disk so operators don't get gaslit. Hard cap at 1 retry per
connect; a second 432 surfaces the original `RegistrationRejected`.

Parser is regex-bound to the IRCd's exact reason text in
`culture/agentirc/client.py:660-666`. A contract test imports both
sites and verifies the wording stays in sync — if a future commit
edits one without the other, that test breaks at the same commit,
not at runtime in production.

Defensive: the parser also validates the candidate prefix is
non-empty, ≤32 chars, and matches `[a-z0-9-]+` (same charset
`sanitize_agent_name` produces) so a hostile IRCd that sends a
crafted 432 with shell metacharacters can never influence the
client's chosen nick.

**Bridge (persistent, holds session)** — fails loud. Pre-9.1.7 the
bridge had NO 432 handler at all: if the IRCd rejected the nick,
the read loop kept spinning, `self.connected` stayed False, and the
daemon log showed nothing actionable. v9.1.7 adds 432 + 433
handlers that log the IRCd's reason text verbatim with the
actionable fix, set `self._should_run = False`, and close the
writer so the read loop exits cleanly. The bridge does NOT
auto-recover the nick.

Why bridges don't auto-recover: an adversarial-critique workflow
before implementation identified 8 blockers in the
naive-auto-recovery design — AuditWriter / IPC socket symlink
desync when `self.nick` mutates, owner_map / role_map / DM-routing
lookups keyed on the stale original nick, hostile-IRCd attack
surface (432 becomes a server-controlled trigger to change client
identity over plain TCP), and log-spam loops under a flapping
IRCd. Fail-loud + operator restart is the right shape for
persistent transports.

### Bug for the observer — Earlier 9.1.6 test contract updated

`test_observer_raises_on_erroneous_nick` (v9.1.6) asserted 432
raised IMMEDIATELY. v9.1.7's auto-recovery overrides that for
canonical 432 shapes — the test is renamed to
`test_observer_raises_on_unparseable_432` and pinned to the
fallback path where the IRCd's reason text doesn't match the
canonical shape (parser returns None, original behavior applies).

### All-backends propagation

Per the cite-don't-import rule, the bridge 432 + 433 handlers
ship in every backend's transport copy:

- `culture/clients/bridge/irc_transport.py` — primary, full doc.
- `culture/clients/claude/irc_transport.py`
- `culture/clients/codex/irc_transport.py`
- `culture/clients/copilot/irc_transport.py`
- `culture/clients/acp/irc_transport.py`
- `packages/agent-harness/irc_transport.py` — template.

### Tests

- 16 new tests in `tests/test_observer_registration.py` covering:
  parser canonical shapes, parser rejection of non-canonical /
  hostile shapes, IRCd-source contract, 432 auto-recovery happy
  path (two-attempt handler), `_MAX_DRIFT_RETRIES = 1` cap,
  unparseable-432 fallback.
- 247/247 across `tests/test_observer_registration.py` +
  `tests/test_manifest_config.py` + `tests/test_boss_cli.py` +
  `tests/cc_plugin/` + `tests/test_culture_bridge_cli.py`.
- All 5 backend `irc_transport.py` copies smoke-import.

## [9.1.6] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed — BUG 1: IRC observer wedged on registration rejections

Another agent reported "Timed out waiting for server welcome; brief
NOT sent" on every `culture boss brief`. Long-lived bridges worked;
fresh connections did not. A discover/synthesize/critique workflow
traced the root cause to **server.name drift between disk and
runtime**: the user had edited `~/.culture/server.yaml::server.name`
in-place (recovering from the v9.1.5 test-fixture leak). The running
IRCd cached its server name at startup; observer code reads server.yaml
fresh on every connection. So when the observer minted a temp nick
using the new value (`plenty-_peekXXX`), the IRCd's nick handler
(`culture/agentirc/client.py:660-666`) sent
`ERR_ERRONEUSNICKNAME (432) Nickname must start with local-`. The
observer's registration loop only handled `001` (welcome) and
`433` (nick in use) — `432` was silently dropped, the loop continued
reading, hit `RECV_TIMEOUT` after 5s, and surfaced as the misleading
"Timed out waiting for server welcome" with zero diagnostic value.

This release pins the v9.1.6 contract on
`culture/observer.py::IRCObserver._connect_and_register`:

- Any IRC numeric in `_FATAL_REGISTRATION_NUMERICS` (432, 464, 465,
  466, 421) raises a new `RegistrationRejected(ConnectionError)`
  immediately. The exception carries the numeric, the server's
  verbatim reason text, the attempted nick, the server_name from
  `server.yaml`, host, and port. Operators see the actual cause +
  a hint to run `culture server migrate-prefix <old> <new>`.
- The `TimeoutError` path additionally reports the last 16 lines
  received so a NOVEL rejection numeric (one not in the fatal set)
  still leaves a paper trail.

### Fixed — BUG 2: server-rename strands existing workers

Same root cause, different symptom path. After an in-place
`server.name` change (or a legitimate `culture server rename` — the
proper rename path had the same gap), every worker's
`culture.yaml::boss:` field still recorded the OLD server-prefix
(e.g. `boss: local-boss`). The running boss now resolved
`CULTURE_NICK = plenty-boss`. Every ownership check
(`boss.py:332`, `agent.py:770`, +5 sites) compared
`plenty-boss == local-boss`, returned False, and rejected each
operation as "owned by another boss" / "not your child — only its
parent may close it". Archived workers were particularly stranded:
`unarchive_manifest_agent` only flipped `state` and never touched
the `boss:` field.

**Two paths fixed:**

1. **The legitimate path** — `rename_manifest_server` (used by
   `culture server rename`) now atomically rewrites
   every worker's `boss:` field from `<old-prefix>-<suffix>` to
   `<new-prefix>-<suffix>` before returning. Pre-9.1.6 the rename
   updated `server.yaml::server.name` and the PID files, but left
   per-worker `culture.yaml` untouched.

2. **The recovery path** — new
   `culture server migrate-prefix <from> [<to>] [--dry-run]` CLI verb
   for the case where the operator already changed `server.name`
   manually (bypassing `culture server rename`). Walks every worker
   in the manifest, loads its `culture.yaml`, rewrites matching
   `boss:` fields, saves. Idempotent.

   ```bash
   # Recovery for the v9.1.5 leak's manual fix path:
   culture server migrate-prefix local         # uses current server.name as <to>
   culture server migrate-prefix local plenty  # explicit
   culture server migrate-prefix local plenty --dry-run
   ```

**AD-2 multi-project safety** preserved by exact-prefix matching:
when migrating `local → plenty`, a worker whose stored boss
happens to start with a DIFFERENT prefix (e.g. `fork-rearch-qa-w1`
with `boss: fork-rearch-qa`) is NOT touched. Match is
`<old>-` (prefix + literal hyphen) so `local` does not match
`local2`.

The adversarial-critique workflow that ran before implementation
explicitly **rejected** a suffix-only ownership-comparison fix (the
naive shape) because it would create cross-project privilege
escalation in the AD-2 multi-project model — `fork-rearch-qa`
could close `culture-rearch-qa`'s workers. Migration is the right
shape; suffix-tolerance is not.

### New helper

- `culture.config.rename_worker_boss_prefix(config_path, old, new)`
  exposed for programmatic use. Idempotent, no-op on equal
  prefixes, returns a list of `(directory, old_boss, new_boss)`
  tuples for the caller to log.

### Tests

- 7 new tests in `tests/test_observer_registration.py` spinning up
  a fake IRCd that sends fatal numerics + asserting
  `RegistrationRejected` surfaces with the right fields, plus a
  novel-numeric case that exercises the timeout-tail reporting.
- 5 new tests in `tests/test_manifest_config.py` covering the
  migration helper: matching rewrite, idempotence, no-op on equal
  prefixes, partial-prefix safety (`local` ≠ `local2`), AD-2
  multi-project safety (foreign boss prefix untouched), and
  end-to-end via `rename_manifest_server`.
- 231/231 across the affected suites. Real `~/.culture/server.yaml`
  verified untouched throughout (CULTURE_HOME isolation working
  cleanly post-9.1.5).

## [9.1.5] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed — CULTURE_HOME isolation in CLI config-path defaults

``culture/cli/shared/constants.py`` exported three module-level
strings — ``DEFAULT_CONFIG``, ``DEFAULT_SERVER_CONFIG``,
``LEGACY_CONFIG`` — each computed at module-import time via
``os.path.expanduser("~/.culture/server.yaml")``. Because
``os.path.expanduser`` resolves ``~`` from ``$HOME`` (NOT from
``CULTURE_HOME``), every test that set ``CULTURE_HOME=<tmp>`` and
invoked the CLI saw the argparse defaults still point at the
operator's REAL ``~/.culture/server.yaml``.

A passing v9.1.4 boundary-acceptance test
(``test_spawn_at_exact_limit_accepts_validation_step``) was the
one that surfaced the bug: the spawn chain ``culture boss spawn``
→ ``culture agent create`` ran in a subprocess that inherited
``CULTURE_HOME=<tmp>`` correctly, but the agent CLI's
``--config`` default was the pre-resolved string from
``DEFAULT_CONFIG``. Result: the test wrote
``server.name = "ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss"`` (its synthetic
30-s server prefix) and a worker entry
``wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww: /private/tmp/pytest-of-test/.../helpers/...``
into the LIVE operator manifest. The operator only noticed when
they opened Mission Control and saw a phantom worker on the mesh
that didn't belong to any real spawn.

This release replaces the import-time string constants with:

- ``culture_home() -> str`` — honors ``CULTURE_HOME`` env, falls
  back to ``~/.culture``
- ``default_config_path() -> str`` — ``culture_home()/server.yaml``
- ``default_legacy_config_path() -> str`` — ``culture_home()/agents.yaml``
- ``default_log_dir() -> str`` — ``culture_home()/logs``

The legacy names ``DEFAULT_CONFIG`` / ``DEFAULT_SERVER_CONFIG`` /
``LEGACY_CONFIG`` / ``LOG_DIR`` are preserved via PEP 562
``module.__getattr__`` so existing ``from .constants import …``
sites continue to work — but every read now resolves
``CULTURE_HOME`` at access time rather than once at import. The
load-bearing argparse defaults (``default=DEFAULT_CONFIG``) thus
get the right path when the parser is built inside a subprocess
whose env was just set by the test runner.

### Tests

- New regression test
  ``test_spawn_at_exact_limit_does_not_corrupt_live_manifest``
  hashes the operator's live ``~/.culture/server.yaml`` before and
  after a boss-spawn invocation under ``CULTURE_HOME=<tmp>`` and
  asserts bit-for-bit identical. Pre-9.1.5 this test would fail
  hard with a sha256 mismatch — captures the regression directly.
- 205/205 across ``tests/test_boss_cli.py`` +
  ``tests/cc_plugin/`` + ``tests/test_culture_bridge_cli.py``.

### Known follow-up (NOT in this PR)

- ``culture/clients/claude/daemon.py:139`` and
  ``culture/clients/copilot/daemon.py:66`` hard-code ``/tmp`` as
  their socket-dir fallback when ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` is unset. On
  macOS (where ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` is never set) these daemons
  bind their IPC sockets at ``/tmp/culture-<nick>.sock`` instead of
  the user-private ``~/Library/Caches/culture/run/<nick>.sock``
  location ``culture/clients/bridge/daemon.py`` correctly uses.
  This release does NOT fix that — separate issue.

## [9.1.4] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed — bridge spawn uses the right Python interpreter

The SessionStart hook spawned the bridge with
``[sys.executable, "-m", "culture", ...]`` (and the boss-spawn /
boss-close paths did the same). When CC fires a hook under bare
``python3`` from ``~/.claude/settings.json``, ``sys.executable``
resolves to the system / Homebrew python — which lacks PyYAML and
dies with ``ModuleNotFoundError: yaml`` the moment the spawned
process imports ``culture/cli/agent.py``. The v9.1.2 spawn-honesty
layer surfaced the traceback correctly; the interpreter selection
was wrong.

This release introduces ``culture/clients/claude/cc_plugin/_python_resolver.py``
with a 3-step resolution ladder, fail-loud at every boundary:

1. **``$CULTURE_PYTHON`` env override** — operator escape hatch.
   Validated via subprocess (``<path> -c 'import culture'``) with a
   2s timeout. Fails hard if the env var is set but the named
   interpreter can't import culture — silently falling through
   would mask explicit configuration.
2. **Repo walk from ``os.path.realpath(__file__)``** → find a
   ``.venv/bin/python3`` next to a ``pyproject.toml`` with
   line-anchored ``name = "culture"``. The hook's resolved location
   is ground truth: the repo CC was told to wire up at install time
   is exactly the repo whose ``.venv`` is the right interpreter.
   Line-anchored regex (not substring) defends against pyproject
   files for OTHER projects that merely mention culture in a
   comment. ``realpath`` (not ``abspath``) defends against symlink
   traps.
3. **``sys.executable`` last resort + stderr warning** naming the
   bug class. The SessionStart honesty layer surfaces any
   subsequent ``ModuleNotFoundError`` so the operator sees a real
   error and can set ``CULTURE_PYTHON`` to fix it.

The earlier blueprint considered two additional steps (sibling
``culture`` launcher discovery + ``shutil.which("culture")`` PATH
search with subprocess verification). Adversarial-critique workflow
(``wqkmqwp6o``) before implementation surfaced 5 blockers:
async/sync mismatch in SSE handlers, 2s shell-out latency stalling
the resolver on first-run, race on the per-process cache, PATH
trust + shebang trust, and last-resort warning being deceptive
'success'. Those steps were dropped from the implementation.

### Fixed — nick resolver no longer truncates long project names

``culture/clients/claude/cc_plugin/_nick_resolver.py`` had two
truncation sites:

- ``_sanitize`` clipped every input to 14 chars BEFORE
  ``_qualify`` ran. A cwd basename of ``plenty-ai-guide-mobile``
  (22 chars) became ``plenty-ai-guid`` (14 chars) — dropping the
  agent half's tail silently.
- ``_qualify`` re-clipped the agent half to ``_MAX_LEN - len(server) - 1``
  chars, double-truncating already-clipped inputs. An already-
  qualified ``local-st4ck-boss`` (16 chars) would have been
  re-clipped to ``local-st4ck-bo`` had it gone through the bare
  branch.

This release adopts "limit at boundary, not at primitives":
``_sanitize`` and ``_qualify`` no longer truncate. A single
``_clip_to_bridge_max`` runs once at the ``resolve_project_nick``
boundary, capping at ``_BRIDGE_MAX_LEN = 64`` (matches the upper
bound ``culture/cli/bridge.py::_validate_nick`` enforces). The clip
emits a WARNING log when it actually fires so operators notice that
their input was outsized.

The constant ``_MAX_LEN = 14`` is gone; the surviving named constant
``_SUFFIX_BUDGET = 14`` is documentation-only and reserved for
future per-spawn-suffix validation. Its run-time analog ships in
this release: ``culture/cli/boss.py::_cmd_spawn`` now rejects
``<boss>-<suffix>`` combinations exceeding 64 chars with a clear
cause, so a long-named boss can't silently fail the bridge's
validation step.

### Operator-visible behavior changes

- Nicks for projects whose names exceed 14 chars now reflect the
  full project name rather than a truncated 14-char prefix. A
  ``plenty-ai-guide-mobile`` cwd that resolved to
  ``plenty-ai-guid`` pre-9.1.4 now resolves to
  ``plenty-ai-guide-mobile`` (the input already contains a hyphen,
  so ``_qualify`` treats it as already-qualified). Operators with
  scripts that depended on the 14-char shape need to update them.
- ``culture boss spawn`` rejects oversize worker nicks locally
  rather than passing them through to a confusing bridge-side
  rejection. Shorten either the boss nick (``CULTURE_BOSS_NICK``)
  or the worker suffix.
- New env var ``CULTURE_PYTHON`` documented in
  ``docs/cc-plugin-python-resolver.md``.

### Tests

- 20 new tests in ``tests/cc_plugin/test_python_resolver.py``
  covering every ladder step, the symlink-trust defense, the
  comment-mention rejection, the env-override fail-hard
  contract, the per-process cache + copy-not-reference contract.
- 4 existing nick tests updated to assert the new
  no-truncate-below-64 contract (the previous assertions captured
  the buggy 14-char behavior).
- 4 new nick tests including the verbatim production regression
  case (``plenty-ai-guide-mobile``).
- 2 new boss-spawn validation tests for the 64-char rejection +
  exact-boundary acceptance.

205/205 across ``tests/cc_plugin/`` + ``tests/test_boss_cli.py``
+ ``tests/test_culture_bridge_cli.py``.

## [9.1.2] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed — mesh-onboarding collisions

End-to-end debugging of the v9.1.1 plugin path surfaced four
collisions where freshly-shipped pieces of v9.1.x silently
disagreed with each other or with the user's existing
`~/.culture/server.yaml`. All four addressed so the SessionStart
hook can actually put a CC session on the mesh on first try.

1. **Nick resolver collision with bridge validator.** The
   `cc_plugin/_nick_resolver` produced bare project names (e.g.
   `culture`), but PR #51's tightened `culture bridge` validator
   requires `<server>-<agent>` shape (Rule 428343). The hook would
   Popen + the bridge would exit 1 immediately + the hook would
   still claim the session was on the mesh. Resolver now
   ALWAYS qualifies with the IRC server's name (`local-culture`,
   `local-payments-api`, …); reads the server name from
   `~/.culture/server.yaml` with a `local` fallback.

2. **Hook lied about bridge spawn success.** `_ensure_bridge_running`
   was fire-and-forget Popen with stderr discarded, and the
   additionalContext composer unconditionally said "you're on the
   mesh." Now: validate the nick before Popen, capture stderr,
   poll the IPC socket for up to 3s, and surface any failure (bad
   nick, child exited non-zero, transport gone) honestly via a
   distinct system-reminder block that says "BRIDGE SPAWN FAILED"
   instead of pretending success.

3. **Bridge `TelemetryConfig` rejected `audit_*` fields.** The
   bridge's cite-don't-import copy of `config.py` did not include
   the agentirc-server `audit_*` telemetry fields, but those are
   present in any real `~/.culture/server.yaml`. Promoted the
   strip-unknown-fields pattern (already in place for AgentConfig)
   to every nested dataclass at load time.

4. **Bridge config loader crashed on the new manifest shape.** The
   bridge's loader assumed `agents:` was a list-of-dicts (old
   inline format). Real manifests use the dict shape
   `{suffix: /path/to/agent/dir}`. The bridge does not need the
   agents list (it spawns for the single nick on the CLI, with a
   synthesized AgentConfig), so the loader now handles either
   shape and silently skips the dict format.

End-to-end verification: `python -m culture.clients.bridge start
local-culture` now reaches the IRC server cleanly; `WHOIS
local-culture` from a probe returns the expected `:local 311
local-probe local-culture local-culture 127.0.0.1 * local-culture`.
The plugin's SessionStart hook, on the next session restart, will
auto-spawn the bridge, and the additionalContext block will only
say "you're on the mesh" when that's actually true.

13 new tests in `tests/cc_plugin/`:
- `TestQualifyServerAgent` (4) — covers `_qualify` + a load-bearing
  assertion that every resolver priority tier emits a `<server>-
  <agent>`-valid nick the bridge CLI will accept.
- `TestBridgeSpawnHonesty` (3) — covers the invalid-nick refusal,
  the failure-surfacing additionalContext shape, and the happy
  path's unchanged shape.
- Updated existing resolver tests to reflect the
  always-qualified output contract.

## [9.1.1] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- `cc_plugin/hooks/session_start.py` now auto-launches the bridge via
  `culture bridge start <nick>` (the new CLI verb from v9.1.0) instead
  of the legacy `culture agent start <nick>` path. The agent-CLI route
  expects the nick to be a manifest entry with a configured backend;
  the bridge-CLI route is exactly what's wanted here — a
  transport-only daemon that's ad-hoc per CC session.

## [9.1.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added — `culture bridge` CLI verb

The follow-up to v9.0.0-rc.1 mesh rearch: a one-command entry point
for the transport-only bridge daemon that holds a CC session's IRC
seat.

- **`culture bridge start <nick> [--channels …] [--tag …] [--foreground]`** —
  spawn a bridge daemon for `<nick>`. Detaches into a new session by
  default; writes `~/.culture/run/bridge-<nick>.pid` (mode 0o600). A
  live PID on second start is refused; a stale PID is cleaned
  silently. Inherits server connection settings from
  `~/.culture/server.yaml`; honors an existing manifest entry's
  channels/tags if the nick is registered, else synthesizes a minimal
  ad-hoc AgentConfig.
- **`culture bridge stop <nick>`** — SIGTERM the recorded PID, remove
  the PID file. Idempotent: missing or stale PID files report cleanly.
- **`culture bridge status`** — list every `bridge-*.pid` under
  `~/.culture/run/` with a `running` / `stale` / `broken` label.

Implementation: thin wrapper around `python -m culture.clients.bridge`
(new `__main__.py` in the bridge package). The CLI deals only with
PID-file lifecycle + background detach; the daemon process is the
existing `AgentDaemon(skip_claude=True)` from v9.0.0-rc.1.

Operator-facing docs in `docs/cross-project-usage.md` updated.

31 regression tests in `tests/test_culture_bridge_cli.py` covering:
nick allowlist validation (5 valid + 8 invalid shapes), PID-file
lifecycle (write/clean-stale/refuse-live), `--channels` / `--tag` /
`--config` argv plumbing, foreground vs background spawn, stop
behavior (live / no-file / stale), status enumeration with
live/stale/broken labels, and CLI registration verifying the bridge
group is wired into `culture/cli/__init__.py`.

## [9.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-06-03

### Mesh Rearchitecture — CC IS the Boss

Fundamental restructuring of how the boss role works on the mesh. The
Claude Code session the user types into now **is** a boss on the
mesh — there is no separate autonomous boss daemon brain running in
parallel. A thin `culture-bridge` process holds the boss's IRC
presence, audit log, daemon log, IPC socket, and filesystem
watchdogs; CC owns every decision via a Claude Code plugin that
exposes 12 `mesh ...` tools.

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-03-mesh-rearchitecture-plan.md`.

### Phase 0 — pre-flight + spikes

- PATH shim and `~/.culture/manifest` GC for stale entries.
- Docs reconcile pass over `docs/agentirc/` and the in-tree skill so
  CC-as-boss is the documented model.
- **UA-2 spike** — confirmed CC accepts mid-conversation
  `<system-reminder>` injection from a plugin tool while a tool call
  is mid-flight. Spike notes at `docs/spikes/ua-2-stop-hook.md`.
- **v8.19.42 carryforward** — ported the 474 `ERR_BANNEDFROMCHAN`
  handler + server-confirmed JOIN tracking from `main` onto this
  branch. The optimistic-JOIN bug that caused silent send-drops
  cannot recur here.
- **Peercred ctypes shim** so the bridge's local IPC socket can
  authenticate the connecting CC process by PID/UID without a fork.
- **Watchdog 6.0.0 smoke** — verified the upgraded `watchdog`
  filesystem observer cleanly watches `perm-queue/` for new request
  files.

### Phase 1 — channel architecture cleanup + polling-prompt strip

- **`#team` is killed.** No global EVERYONE channel. Server-side ACL
  refuses all JOINs to `#team`. Existing history is preserved (it is
  durable evidence) but no agent auto-joins and no ACL admits anyone.
  Discovery happens via `mesh who`; targeted talk via DM; group
  coordination via opt-in `#joint-<topic>` (cross-boss) or
  `#team-<project>` (per-boss sibling fireplace).
- **Unified channel-class ACL.** The server-side gate at
  `culture/agentirc/client.py` now classifies every channel into
  `task-<own>`, `task-<other>`, `team-<project>`, `joint-<topic>`,
  or legacy `#team` and applies one consistent rule table instead of
  the previous per-prefix patchwork.
- **Polling-prompt strip across all 4 backends.** The literal
  "Check IRC channels periodically with `irc_read()` for new
  messages." (and its near-paraphrases) is removed from the SDK
  system prompts in all four backends:
  - `culture/clients/claude/daemon.py`
  - `culture/clients/copilot/daemon.py`
  - `culture/clients/codex/daemon.py`
  - `culture/clients/acp/daemon.py`
  All inbound delivery is push (via `on_mention`, `on_dm`,
  `on_roominvite`). No agent prompt instructs polling anywhere in
  the tree.

### Phase 2 — bridge skeleton (the structural core)

- New `culture/bridge/` process — owns IRC transport, audit log,
  daemon log, IPC socket, and watchdogs. **No SDK loop, no LLM.**
- IPC contract docs at `protocol/extensions/bridge-ipc.md`
  enumerating the 16 verbs the bridge accepts (the original 13
  IRC/thread verbs + `status` + `shutdown` + `compact` repurposed
  as a daemon-log record).
- `MessageBuffer` gains cursor persistence so a bridge restart no
  longer re-delivers ~200 HISTORY-replayed messages as "unread".
- `CHANARCHIVE` on shutdown — bridge flips `#task-*` channels to
  persistent before disconnecting so history survives the
  last-member PART auto-delete.
- Bridge boots with `skip_claude=True`; the existing
  `daemon.py:start()` startup sequence is reused for the
  non-SDK arms (IRC presence, IPC, watchdogs, manifest invariants).

### Phase 3 — server-side per-nick DM spool

- **Server-side DM spool** in `agentirc` — DMs targeted at an
  offline nick are persisted in a SQLite spool sized and shaped
  like `history_store.py`. On reconnect, the bridge issues IRCv3
  `draft/chathistory` to drain. Spool schema:
  `(msg_id PK, sender, recipient, ts_server, payload, tags, delivered_at)`.
- **IDOR guard** — the spool's `CHATHISTORY` handler refuses to
  return rows where `recipient != requesting nick`. A boss cannot
  drain another boss's spool by guessing IDs.
- **Two-phase drain** — on reconnect the bridge first acknowledges
  pending IDs, then commits delivery; a crash between phases does
  not lose messages (idempotent replay).

### Phase 4 — CC plugin (CC IS the boss)

- New Claude Code plugin under `culture/plugin/cc/` installed by a
  user-settings hook installer.
- **12 mesh tools** — `mesh send`, `mesh dm`, `mesh inbox`,
  `mesh who`, `mesh status`, `mesh join`, `mesh part`, `mesh topic`,
  `mesh ask`, `mesh thread_create`, `mesh thread_reply`,
  `mesh thread_close`. All route through the bridge IPC socket; no
  direct IRC from CC.
- **Project-named bosses** — boss nick defaults from the cwd's git
  remote name; explicit override via `culture boss init --name X`
  or `mesh status` on first turn. Legacy `local-boss` remains a
  fallback.
- **Worker auto-prefix** — a boss named `fork-rearch` spawning a
  worker `qa` lands as nick `fork-rearch-qa` in channel
  `#task-fork-rearch-qa`. Single hyphen separator; tools split on
  `-` to recover the namespace. Max 14+14 chars under IRC's 30-char
  nick cap.

### Phase 5 — perm broker atomic security

- `DEFAULT_BOSS_CEILING` removed — see Breaking changes.
- New `BareStickyApproveRefusedError` raised by
  `_append_sticky_rule` when an `--always` rule for
  `Bash`/`Edit`/`Write`/`mcp__*` lacks an `input_regex`. The boss
  can either supply the regex and retry, or accept the demotion.
- **Demote-rather-than-fail** — when the broker would otherwise
  bypass-block a sticky rule, it now demotes the rule to
  `scope=once` and drops a `perm-demote-notices/<id>.json` file so
  the boss and dashboard see exactly what was downgraded and why.
- `on_request` cascade removed from
  `PermissionBroker.__init__` / `AgentRunner.__init__` — push
  notification of new perm requests now flows through the watchdog
  FS observer, not a callback chain.
- **Watchdog filesystem observer** on `perm-queue/` replaces the
  polling loop. Bridge sees a new request the instant the worker
  writes it.

### Phase 6 — worker resilience (plenty-staging-boss's findings)

- **Bridge silent-death watchdog persistence** — the `silent_death`
  classifier now writes its state under `~/.culture/watchdog/state/`
  so a bridge restart does not reset the "this worker has been
  silent for N minutes" counter.
- **Stall DM enrichment (plenty's P1)** — the DM the bridge sends
  to the boss when a worker stalls now includes the last assistant
  message, the last tool call, and the tail of the worker's
  daemon-log. The boss can decide whether to nudge or close the
  worker without an extra `culture boss audit` round-trip.
- **Atomic spawn+brief (plenty's P2)** — `culture boss spawn` now
  takes an optional `--brief "<text>"` flag that creates the worker
  AND delivers the first brief in one atomic operation. Either both
  succeed or both roll back. Removes the "spawned but never
  briefed" failure window.
- **Worker checkpointing (plenty's P0b, partial)** — workers now
  emit a `checkpoint` daemon-log record at each turn boundary
  capturing the current task focus. A restarted worker reads its
  most recent checkpoint before reading the channel brief, so a
  crash mid-task does not reset focus to "joining the channel".

### Breaking changes

- `DEFAULT_BOSS_CEILING` and the entire ceiling stack
  (`_boss_policy_dir`, `boss_policy_path_for`,
  `write_default_boss_ceiling`, `load_boss_ceiling`,
  `is_above_ceiling`, and the ceiling re-check inside `gate()`) are
  **removed**. A boss can grant a worker any tool the boss itself
  has; runtime tool authority is governed by the worker's policy
  file.
- `on_request` callback removed from `PermissionBroker.__init__`.
  Push notification now flows through the watchdog FS observer.
- `on_perm_request` removed from `AgentRunner.__init__`.
- `#team` channel is **frozen** server-side. ACL refuses all new
  JOINs. Existing message history is preserved but no agent can
  enter the channel.
- Deleted tests: `tests/test_boss_grant_ceiling.py`,
  `tests/test_perm_broker_on_request.py`.

### All-backends carve-out

Phase 4 (CC-as-boss CC plugin) ships **for Claude only** in v1.
Codex/Copilot/ACP bosses retain their existing autonomous-daemon
model from v8.x. This deliberately violates the all-backends rule
documented in `CLAUDE.md` — for the **boss role specifically**.

The shared infrastructure DOES apply to all backends because it
lives at the IRC server or shared-code layer:

- Workers confined to `#task-<own>` (server-side ACL, Phase 1).
- Server-side DM spool (Phase 3, in `agentirc`).
- No-grant-ceiling permission broker (Phase 5, in
  `culture/clients/_perm_broker.py`).
- Polling-prompt strip (Phase 1, applied to all 4 backend
  system prompts).

Follow-up issue tracks bringing the codex/copilot/acp bosses onto
the bridge model in a later release. Tracked in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-03-mesh-rearchitecture-plan.md`.

## [8.19.25] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed — SDK inactivity hangs the agent runner

The `async for message in query(...)` loop in
`culture/clients/claude/agent_runner.py` had no per-message timeout.
When the SDK pipe wedged (Stream-closed, hung MCP tool result,
dropped subprocess stream), the daemon sat in `__anext__()`
indefinitely — the v8.18.4 / v8.19.8 watchdogs observed the silence
via daemon-log but had no way to act on it. Caught live during the
UX-eval worker run: an `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot`
returned the screenshot to disk but the SDK never yielded the next
message; daemon stalled for 5 minutes before the watchdog logged
`stalled_post_engagement`.

Fix: wrap `__anext__()` in `asyncio.wait_for(timeout=180s)`. On
timeout, raise `RuntimeError("SDK stream inactivity timeout ...")`
which hits the existing `except Exception` block — fires
`on_turn_failed`, then `on_exit(1)`, daemon's crash-recovery
restarts the session. The watchdog goes from advisory to
self-healing.

Configurable via `CULTURE_SDK_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` env var (seconds,
float). Default 180s — comfortably above real assistant turns
including thinking + long tool calls, low enough to recover within
a few minutes when the SDK genuinely wedges.

### Added — UX evaluation of the dashboard

`docs/v8.19.24-ux-evaluation.md` — 140-line evaluation authored by
`local-ux-eval-w` (mesh worker, after restart with the v8.19.25
fix). 8 ranked findings covering the user's "hardly any information
here about the channel" complaint:

| # | Severity | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Critical | No timeline info (started / last-active) |
| 2 | Critical | No task purpose visible at a glance |
| 3 | High | No health / stuck indicators |
| 4 | High | No per-channel pending-permissions count |
| 5 | Medium | No living brief preview on Channel cards |
| 6 | Medium | Channel title truncation hides context |
| 7 | Low | No cost conversion for tokens |
| 8 | Low | Second channel group lacks token badge |

Each finding has SYMPTOM / ROOT CAUSE / PROPOSED FIX with concrete
file:line references. Screenshot at
`docs/v8.19.24-ux-eval-channels.png`.

The findings drive the next dashboard iteration: add `started_at`
and `last_activity` to the task dicts, surface watcher state on
the Channel heading, add a brief-preview subtitle.

## [8.19.24] - 2026-05-31

### Added — living channel brief (worker onboarding)

User flagged: *"does a new worker get briefed on what has transpired,
like a new employee or team mate joining a project gets? Maybe we
should keep an updating brief for each channel?"*

A new worker spawned into `#task-<name>` used to read the last N
IRC HISTORY lines and that was its entire context. The v8.19.18
seed is **write-once initial** (the original mission). This release
adds the living sibling.

- New `culture/clients/_channel_brief.py` — persistence + read API
  for `~/.culture/briefs/<channel-without-hash>.md`. Each call
  appends a dated `## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ — <title>` Markdown section.
- **`culture boss brief` auto-appends** on every successful send,
  building the running onboarding doc as work happens.
- **New `culture boss note <channel-or-name> "<text>" [--title T]`**
  for explicit non-task updates (decisions, status, gotchas).
  Accepts a channel name or worker suffix.
- **All 4 backends inject the brief into the SDK system prompt** on
  worker boot. For each channel in the agent's config that has a
  brief, the daemon appends a "Joining channel — current state"
  section so the worker boots already onboarded. Wrapped with
  framing so the worker treats it as context, not as a current
  instruction.
- **Read cap of 64 KiB** — runaway briefs read as the TAIL with
  early history elided. Can't blow a worker's context window.
- **Idempotence guard**: identical body in the same minute window
  is skipped (defends against duplicate brief fires).
- **Dashboard endpoint** `/api/channels/<name>/brief` returns the
  full text + bytes; 404 on missing.
- Path-traversal-safe channel→filename validation.

### Tests

- 14 new in `tests/test_channel_brief.py`: roundtrip, append,
  empty-body skip, unsafe-name guard, has_brief, clear idempotent,
  idempotence within minute, different body, read-cap truncation,
  system-prompt-extension framing, file under culture_home,
  traversal rejected.
- 3 new in `tests/test_dashboard.py::TestChannelBrief`: 404 / 200 /
  400.

## [8.19.23] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed — orchestrator-friction bugs

A fresh Claude Code session asked to drive a worker via the
documented `culture boss …` flow had to debug the harness instead of
using it. Captured the friction in
`docs/v8.19.22-orchestrator-friction.md` and fixed the top four
items.

- **Manifest-warning flood.** `resolve_agents` printed one
  `WARNING culture.yaml missing for <nick>` per stale manifest entry
  on every CLI invocation — 10+ lines of noise on a long-running
  mesh, drowning real output. Now: per-entry detail logged at
  `DEBUG`, ONE summary line at `WARNING` saying how many entries
  point at missing paths and what command cleans them up. New test
  `test_resolve_agents_many_missing_yields_one_summary_warning`.
- **`culture boss spawn` printed a confusing multi-agent error.**
  Spawning a worker into a cwd whose `culture.yaml` defines multiple
  agents printed `Multiple agents in <path>. Use --suffix...` then
  continued anyway. The worker came up correctly but the operator
  thought it had failed. Fixed by passing `--suffix=<name>` through
  to the underlying `culture agent register` call — spawn already
  knows the suffix (it's the worker name).
- **`culture boss brief` failed with no recovery path.**
  Without the boss daemon running, brief returned
  `Error: could not brief <nick> (is the boss daemon running?)`.
  True, but the orchestrator now has to know that "boss daemon" is
  distinct from "boss identity" AND that `culture boss status`
  doesn't surface the daemon state. Error message now prints the
  exact fix command:
  `Start it with: culture agent start <boss>`.
- **`culture boss status` was silent on the boss's own daemon.**
  The worker table didn't surface whether `brief`/`approve`/`deny`
  could actually run. New leading `BOSS <nick> <state> <pid>` row,
  with an inline hint when the daemon is down. `sys.stdout.flush()`
  before the subprocess so the row prints first under pipes.

### Captured (not fixed yet)

- `culture boss init` — single command that ensures server + boss
  daemon are up. Tracked in `docs/v8.19.22-orchestrator-friction.md`
  item #5.
- Living per-channel brief (`~/.culture/briefs/<channel>.md`) so
  new workers get onboarded with current project state rather than
  just IRC HISTORY. User-flagged as the more important sibling to
  the v8.19.18 seed (which is write-once initial only). Tracked as
  item #6. Coming as v8.19.24.

## [8.19.22] - 2026-05-31

### Changed — Channel data-model reframe (user clarification)

User flagged that calling each `#task-<worker>` a "task" was
confusing — *the Channel IS the Task*. Inside one Channel are
several rooms: the group chat, the boss board, and one private
boss↔worker dialog per worker. Adopted that model:

- Group heading now reads `CHANNEL <task title>` with the
  channel-level token total prominently rendered.
- Channel-level `tokens_total` counts each member exactly once
  via a unique-nicks set so the boss isn't N-times counted.
- Per-`#task-<worker>` room tag changed from `TASK` to `WORKER`.
- Per-card `tokens_total` demoted to a subtle grey sub-cost; the
  primary total lives on the Channel heading.

### Fixed

- **Chat tab showed empty for many rooms.** Card-body click
  selected the agent and fetched `/api/channel/<agent>` — which
  resolves to that agent's home `#task-<worker>`, NOT the room
  the user clicked. So clicking `#team` showed an empty
  `#task-<first-member>` instead of the `#team` history.
  New `state.selectedChannel` carries the clicked room. Card
  click sets it (route to room); chip click clears it (revert
  to agent's home). `refreshChat` routes through
  `/api/channels/<name>/messages` when set, falling back to
  `/api/channel/<nick>` otherwise. Live-verified: clicking
  `#team` → 50 messages, `#boss` → 11 messages.
- **Stream tabs + title now sticky** at the top of the centre
  column (`position: sticky` on `#stream-title` and
  `.stream-tabs`). Scrolling deep into a long chat no longer
  hides Activity / Daemon actions / Chat.

### Tests

- 2 new in `tests/test_dashboard_seed_integration.py`:
  channel-level `tokens_total` uniqueness (boss not
  double-counted across rooms), per-`#task-<worker>` category
  is `"worker"`.

## [8.19.21] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Per-agent + per-task token-usage badges in the dashboard.**
  Each channel card now shows a total-tokens badge in the header
  (sum of every member's cumulative usage) and each member chip
  shows its own contribution. The header badge is the *task total*
  per the user's clarification that channel ≈ task — the grouping
  heading (`<boss>'s work`) is one level higher.
- New `culture/clients/_usage.py`. Persists per-turn token records
  to `~/.culture/usage/<nick>.jsonl` — one line per LLM turn,
  shape: `{"ts": "...", "in": N, "out": M, "model": "..."}`.
  Helpers: `record_turn_usage` / `record_turn_usage_sync` /
  `sum_tokens` / `clear_usage` / `usage_path_for`. Disk write
  errors are swallowed — usage is advisory, must NOT block the
  agent loop.
- Wired through all 4 backends per the all-backends rule
  (`culture/clients/claude/agent_runner.py`,
  `culture/clients/codex/agent_runner.py`,
  `culture/clients/copilot/agent_runner.py`,
  `culture/clients/acp/agent_runner.py`). Claude actively records
  `tokens_input`/`tokens_output` from the SDK `ResultMessage.usage`;
  codex/copilot/acp pass `None`/`None` today (no-op) until their
  SDKs expose token counts (issues #298 / #299) — the call sites
  stay so when usage arrives, only the dict needs to be threaded.
- `list_tasks` (`culture/dashboard/server.py`) stamps every
  member with `tokens_used` / `tokens_in` / `tokens_out` and every
  channel with `tokens_total`. Internal per-call memoization
  prevents reading the boss's usage file once per channel (the
  boss is in every channel of its task).
- Frontend (`app.js`) renders `.channel-tokens-total` at the top
  of each card (only when > 0) and `.token-badge` per member chip
  (only when > 0). New `formatTokens` helper: 999→`999t`,
  12 345→`12.3k`, 4 567 890→`4.6M`.

### Fixed

- **Card click stuck on `local-boss` regardless of which task you
  clicked.** Previously every `#task-*` card defaulted to the boss
  member (the boss is in every task channel) AND auto-switched
  the stream tab to Chat, so the Activity tab never changed
  content when the user clicked different tasks. Now the card
  click picks the FIRST WORKER (non-boss member) and PRESERVES
  the user's currently-active stream tab — clicking a task while
  on Activity now actually shows that task's worker's activity.
  Live-verified via st4ck browse: `#task-builder` →
  `local-builder · Activity`, `#task-research` →
  `local-research · Activity`.

### Tests

- 12 new tests in `tests/test_usage.py`: record + sum roundtrip,
  multi-turn append, both-None no-op, input-only / output-only
  paths, negative-value rejected, missing file → zeros, malformed
  line skip, clear idempotent, file under culture_home, async
  wrapper, OSError swallowed.
- 4 new tests in `tests/test_dashboard_seed_integration.py`:
  per-member tokens_used stamping, channel tokens_total sum,
  zero-when-no-records, per-nick cache prevents N reads of the
  boss's file inside one `list_tasks` call.
- Live-verified token rendering in real browser: 23 of 26 cards
  show totals when seeded with realistic data; per-chip badges
  populated; format readable (`245k`, `380k`).

## [8.19.20] - 2026-05-31

### Added — edge-case test fleet (67 new tests across 5 files)

In response to *"did you test both backend and front end testing for
everything? especially edge cases"* — the honest answer was *not
comprehensively*, so this ships the missing coverage.

- **Functional UI walkthrough via st4ck browse** against the live
  v8.19.19 dashboard: 3 main-tab + 3 stream-tab paths, channel-card
  click → chat-stream open, member-chip click → audit-stream open,
  seed-brief expand/collapse with lazy-fetch full body, 12-cycle
  rapid tab switching with zero console errors, MutationObserver
  confirmed 0 mutations on idle, scrollTop=250 preserved across
  multiple poll cycles, cache headers + asset version-busting,
  endpoint contracts (200/400/404).
- **`tests/test_watcher_alerts_edges.py`** (22 tests). Direct
  `AlertRouter` coverage — formatting helpers (severity prefix
  mapping, subject + body, webhook payload), `irc_recipients`
  gates, every `send_email` config gate, SMTP failure tolerance,
  `send_webhook` empty-URL / unreachable-URL fallback, real
  localhost HTTP server with secret-header verification,
  `from_config_dict` tolerance for missing / None-valued subkeys
  + list-to-tuple coercion.
- **`tests/test_watcher_io_edges.py`** (20 tests). `_read_jsonl_tail`
  IO edges (missing, empty, malformed mixed with valid, max_lines
  returns LAST N, trailing newlines, UTF-8 content, post-truncation).
  Threshold boundaries for `detect_crash_burst` (exactly `min_count`,
  mixed inside/outside window), `detect_token_spike` (exactly at
  threshold is silent — uses `>`; alternate `input` key; non-numeric
  rejected), `detect_mission_stuck` (engaged inside window).
  Aggregator gates: empty `enabled` set, missing `pidfile_dir`
  skips `silent_death`, missing `action` field handled.
- **`tests/test_watcher_service_edges.py`** (10 tests). Dispatch
  isolation (IRC failure does not block email + webhook; email
  failure does not block webhook). Intra-batch cooldown dedupe.
  `run_forever` responds to `stop_event` within poll interval.
  `run_once` with empty globs is a no-op.
  `WatcherConfig.from_dict` tolerates mixed string/dict patterns
  and a YAML list at root. `_persistent_observer_lifecycle` wires
  `app[_OBSERVER]` at startup and calls `close()` at shutdown
  (verified via aiohttp `TestClient`); fallback to `None` when
  observer construction throws (endpoints still 200).
- **`tests/test_dashboard_seed_integration.py`** (7 tests).
  End-to-end seed flow against the real `list_tasks` output:
  per-channel `seed_preview` populated, task title falls back
  through seed → mission.md → `<nick>'s work`, 80-char truncation
  with ellipsis, leading-blank-line skip, multi-worker
  first-seed-wins preference.
- **`tests/test_persistent_observer_edges.py`** (8 tests). HISTORY
  timeout path (returns what it has, no crash), unreachable-port
  returns `[]` not raise, CRLF injection guard on `send_message`
  target, pure-newline body short-circuits before connect,
  `close()` resets writer/reader/nick (next read reconnects with
  fresh nick), `close()` on never-connected is no-op + idempotent,
  nick uses `_peek` prefix so v8.19.13 server-side suppression
  still applies, three concurrent `read_channel` calls all return
  cleanly via the lock.

### Fixed

- **Intra-batch cooldown dedupe** in
  `culture.watcher.service.WatcherService.cooldown_filter`.
  Previously a single dispatch batch with two events sharing the
  same `pattern:target` key would fire BOTH (state.in_cooldown
  was only updated by `record_firing` between events, not within
  a batch). Now `cooldown_filter` tracks `seen_keys` per call.
  Caught by `test_cooldown_filter_dedupes_same_key_within_one_batch`.

## [8.19.19] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Deterministic mesh-state watcher** (the user's "ask 1" — *"a
  deterministic system watcher that keeps looking at the activity
  table, looking for patterns and sending an email to me + nudging
  you as boss"*). Background process; reads
  `~/.culture/daemon-log/*.jsonl`, `~/.culture/audit/*.jsonl`,
  `~/.culture/perm-queue/`; evaluates 5 MVP failure patterns;
  ships alerts over IRC/email/webhook with per-pattern cooldown
  dedupe. Out-of-process, no LLM token quota, survives every
  other component's restart. Closed-loop guard.
- **5 MVP patterns** in `culture/watcher/patterns.py`:
  `silent_death` (agent_start with no agent_exit + pidfile PID
  gone), `crash_burst` (≥3 crash records in 5 min), `token_spike`
  (>50 000 input tokens in 10 min), `perm_escalation_above_ceiling`
  (pending request names a boss-denylisted tool), `mission_stuck`
  (boss running ≥2 h with no engaged or assistant activity).
- **3 alert sinks** in `culture/watcher/alerts.py`. IRC is on by
  default; routes to `target_nick` (the boss/orchestrator) AND
  `#alerts`. Email is opt-in (SMTP, STARTTLS, password sourced
  from `password_env` — never the literal). Webhook is opt-in
  (JSON POST, optional `X-Culture-Watcher-Secret` header). All
  sink errors are logged but never propagate.
- **Persistent cooldown cache** in
  `culture/watcher/state.py`. Per-firing key is
  `pattern_name:target`; default 600 s window. Atomic file rename
  on save; corrupt JSON → treated as empty (degrades to "first
  run" semantics rather than crashing).
- **`culture watcher {start,once,status,test}` CLI** plus
  `python -m culture.watcher` entry. `test` synthesizes a fake
  silent-death event and bypasses cooldown — useful for wiring a
  new SMTP relay.
- **Config schema** in `~/.culture/watcher.yaml` (sample at
  `culture/watcher/watcher.example.yaml`). Missing file →
  defaults; bad fields warned + ignored.
- **`PersistentObserver` re-use** for IRC alerts. The watcher
  reuses the same long-lived class the dashboard introduced in
  v8.19.17 so a 30 s poll never opens + tears down a TCP+IRC
  handshake every pass.
- **Documentation**: `docs/watcher.md` (pattern list, sink
  table, sample config, CLI cheatsheet, scope limits).

### Tests

- 17 in `tests/test_watcher_patterns.py`: each detector covered
  with fire-condition + 2–3 silent-condition cases; aggregator
  honors the `enabled` set; `PatternEvent.key` stable across
  same-target firings.
- 12 in `tests/test_watcher_service.py`: state persistence +
  reload, cooldown window math, GC, corrupt-state-file
  tolerance, config parsing (defaults + explicit), dispatch
  routing to IRC, cooldown suppresses repeats, different keys
  both fire, full `run_once` end-to-end against a synthetic
  `culture_home` with a silent-death pidfile.
- **Live verification**: `culture watcher once` against the
  active dev mesh found 19 real silent-death/mission-stuck
  alerts from past worker generations.

## [8.19.18] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Channel topics + seed-brief panel** (user ask: "channels should be
  named/titled by TOPIC, with a top tab/section showing the INITIAL
  SEED TEXT the boss had when opening the channel").
- **`culture boss spawn --topic "..."`** — sets the IRC TOPIC on
  `#task-<worker>` at spawn time AND writes the full text to
  `~/.culture/seeds/task-<worker>.md` so the dashboard can surface it
  without scrolling back through HISTORY.
- **`culture boss brief` auto-seeds** — if a task channel has no seed
  yet, the first brief becomes the seed AND sets the channel's IRC
  TOPIC (truncated to ~200 chars for the protocol line). Idempotent:
  subsequent briefs don't overwrite, so the original mission stays
  visible.
- **New `culture/clients/_seed.py`** — `persist_seed` (write-once by
  default), `load_seed`, `clear_seed`. Persistence path is
  `~/.culture/seeds/<channel-without-hash>.md` via the existing
  `seed_path_for` helper in `_perm_broker.py` (path-traversal-safe).
- **New `/api/channels/<name>/seed` endpoint** — returns the
  persisted seed with timestamp; 404 when no seed exists.
- **Dashboard rendering** — each channel card now shows a "▸ Seed
  brief" toggle when `seed_preview` is set, with lazy-fetch of the
  full text on first expand. CSS additions: `.channel-seed`,
  `.seed-toggle`, `.seed-preview-line`, `.seed-body`.
- **Task-group title falls back through TOPIC/seed → mission.md
  headline → boss-nick** — `list_tasks` now stamps every channel
  with `seed_preview` and uses the first non-empty per-worker seed as
  the task title.
- **Channel renaming is out of scope** (would break agent membership
  + ACLs + HISTORY continuity). The dashboard maps `#task-<nick>` to
  its topic for display only.

### Tests

- 9 new tests in `tests/test_seed.py`: persist/load roundtrip,
  idempotence, explicit overwrite, empty text skipped, missing
  returns None, clear removes, unsafe channel name rejected,
  multi-line body preserved, file lives under culture_home.
- 3 new tests in `tests/test_dashboard.py::TestSeed`: missing seed
  → 404, existing seed → 200 with text, invalid channel name → 400.

## [8.19.17] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **`PersistentObserver` for the dashboard.** New class in
  `culture/observer.py` that holds ONE TCP connection + IRC
  registration across the dashboard's lifetime. Channels are joined
  lazily on first read and stay joined; auto-reconnect re-JOINs the
  membership set after a server bounce. Replaces ~24 ephemeral peek
  connections per minute (every 2.5 s chat poll) with one persistent
  connection.
- **Nick prefix is `_peekDASH<hex>`** so the v8.19.13 server-side
  event suppression continues to silence the observer's JOINs — its
  membership remains invisible to other channel members.
- **Single asyncio.Lock around the connection** serializes requests so
  HISTORY responses can be demuxed cleanly. Dashboard polls are
  infrequent (sub-second reads at 2.5 s cadence) so serialization is
  not a bottleneck.
- **Dashboard wiring** via aiohttp `cleanup_ctx`: one observer is
  built in `_persistent_observer_lifecycle` and exposed at
  `app[_OBSERVER]`. New `_observer_for(request)` helper prefers the
  persistent observer and falls back to the ephemeral `get_observer()`
  if instantiation failed at boot.
- Wired through `/api/channel/{nick}`, `/api/message`, and
  `/api/channels/{name}/messages`.

### Tests

- 5 new tests in `tests/test_persistent_observer.py` against a real
  IRCd: repeated reads of the same channel JOIN once (10 reads → 1
  JOIN line broadcast), reads on a new channel lazy-JOIN, send_message
  reuses the same nick, `close()` shuts down, auto-reconnect after a
  forced writer close re-JOINs the membership set.
- 45 dashboard tests still pass — chat-related tests updated to
  monkeypatch `server._observer_for` for clean DI.

## [8.19.16] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **Dashboard flicker that v8.19.15 "fixed" was still reported by the
  user after they refreshed — root cause was browser cache.**
  v8.19.14 and v8.19.15 both touched `culture/dashboard/static/app.js`
  but the served URL is the unversioned `/static/app.js`. A tab opened
  before the fix landed sits on the stale bundle indefinitely. The
  user kept seeing the OLD code's flicker even though I'd
  live-verified the new code works (zero DOM mutations in 8s).
- **Fix: cache-bust + no-cache on index.html.** `_handle_index` now
  reads `index.html`, rewrites `/static/app.js` → `/static/app.js?v=<version>`
  and the same for `style.css`, and serves with
  `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` + `Pragma: no-cache`
  + `Expires: 0`. So:
  - The HTML shell is never cached — every page load asks the server.
  - Static assets ARE cached per-URL (cheap on CDN-style fetches),
    but each `pyproject.toml` version bump changes the URL →
    automatic invalidation. No more "hard-refresh to pick up a
    hotfix."
- Version sourced from `culture.__version__` (`importlib.metadata`),
  so the buster updates automatically on every release.
- Live-verified end-to-end: restarted dashboard, fresh browser session
  loaded `app.js?v=8.19.16` + `style.css?v=8.19.16`, MutationObserver
  recorded **0 mutations in 10 seconds** across `#channel-list`,
  `#agent-list`, `#pending-list`, `#stream`.
- 45/45 dashboard tests pass.

## [8.19.15] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **Dashboard left-panel flicker, round 2 (the actual user-reported bug).**
  v8.19.14 fixed the stream/chat panel but the user kept seeing the
  display "nuked every couple of seconds" — root cause was different:
  `refreshChannels` (every 3s), `refreshAgents` (every 2.5s), and
  `refreshPending` (every 2s) each unconditionally called
  `container.replaceChildren()` plus a full re-render even when the
  data was identical. The user saw the channel/agent list flicker
  every poll cycle and any scroll position into a long list reset.
- **Fix is JSON-snapshot skip-when-unchanged + scroll preservation.**
  New `withListSnapshot(listId, data, render)` helper:
  (a) `JSON.stringify`s the incoming payload and compares against the
  previous snapshot — same payload = same DOM, so the render callback
  is SKIPPED entirely (no replaceChildren, no flicker, no scroll
  reset); (b) on a real data change, snapshots the parent scroll
  container's `scrollTop` BEFORE the rebuild and restores it AFTER so
  a long-list scroll position survives an update.
- Wired through `refreshChannels`, `refreshAgents`, `refreshPending`,
  `refreshArchived`. Live-verified in a real browser via st4ck:
  tagged child elements survived 8s of poll cycles on `#channel-list`
  and `#agent-list`; scrollTop=200 on the parent SECTION survived
  multiple poll cycles unchanged.
- Single-file change: `culture/dashboard/static/app.js`.

## [8.19.14] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **Dashboard activity panel nuked every 2.5s, scroll-up unreachable.**
  Channel-mode chat polled `/api/channel/<nick>` every 2.5s and called
  `box.replaceChildren()` on every poll — wiping any scroll-up position
  and yanking the user back to the bottom. Activity / daemon-log SSE
  paths force-scrolled to bottom on every appended record, blocking
  scrollback while live data was streaming.
- **Fix is append-only + scroll-position preservation.** `refreshChat`
  now diffs the message list, finds the previously rendered tail in
  the new list, and appends only the delta (falls back to a full
  re-render when the server-side log rotated). `renderActivityTurn`
  and `appendStreamLine` snapshot `isAtBottom(box)` before appending
  and only auto-scroll if the user was already at the bottom — if
  they've scrolled up to read history, the scrollbar stays put.
- New `state.chatLastMessages` / `state.chatLastChannel` diff baseline,
  reset on `openStream` (channel switch). Threshold for "at bottom" is
  40px to tolerate sub-pixel layout drift in the channel list.
- Single-file change: `culture/dashboard/static/app.js`. Static asset
  cache-busted by the version bump.

## [8.19.13] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **Peek JOIN/PART events poisoned all channel buffers** — the v8.19.12
  welcome-bot fix suppressed only the welcome message, but the
  underlying `user.join` event continued firing for every peek
  connection. The events skill turns `user.join` into a `system-local`
  PRIVMSG that lands in every channel member's message buffer.
  Result: every agent subscribed to `#team` was still pulling
  `<system-local> local-_peekXXXX joined #team` lines into its
  next-turn SDK context. Token leak continued.
- **Architectural fix at the event-emission site**: `Client._handle_join`
  and `Client._handle_part` now skip `emit_event` for nicks whose
  agent-suffix starts with `_peek`. Raw IRC JOIN/PART protocol lines
  still broadcast to channel members (membership semantics unchanged);
  only the event-as-PRIVMSG observer-noise pathway is gated.
- Tests: 12/12 in `tests/test_channel.py` (2 new — peek suppression +
  real-agent symmetry confirming raw JOIN + welcome bot still fire
  for non-peek nicks).

## [8.19.12] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **Welcome-bot peek filter was a silent no-op** (v8.19.10 regression).
  Filter referenced `event.nick` but bot_manager passes the event
  context FLAT (`type`, `nick`, `channel`, `data` at top level).
  `event.nick` resolved to MISSING → `in` returned False → `not`
  returned True → welcome fired on every peek connection regardless.
  Corrected to `not ('_peek' in nick)`. Live-verified the AST
  evaluates: peek nick → False (skip), real worker → True (welcome),
  non-join event → False (not a join).

## [8.19.11] - 2026-05-31

User-requested restructure of the Channels tab: group by TASK (per
the task-model doc's "channels-are-tasks" framing) instead of by
channel category.

### Added

- **`/api/tasks` endpoint + `list_tasks()` builder** — returns one
  task object per boss agent, each with `title` (read from the
  boss's `mission.md` first body line, fallback to `<boss>'s work`),
  `state` (running/stopped), `worker_count`, and a `channels` array
  containing the boss's `#boss` channel + its `#joint-*` channels +
  one `#task-<worker>` per owned worker, sorted boss→joint→task.
- **Task group rendering** in the Channels tab — header with task
  state dot + title + boss-nick badge + worker count, followed by
  the task's channel cards.
- Orphan workers (a manifest entry with `boss:` pointing at a nick
  that has no boss-tagged agent) get a synthetic "Unassigned
  workers" task so they don't vanish from view.

### Why

User asked for channels grouped as tasks — "channel title, and below
we would see the boss channel, then group channel and then the
channels the boss has with each agent." The old by-category grouping
made it harder to see at a glance what each boss was driving.

## [8.19.10] - 2026-05-31

Hotfix after first dashboard restart with the channels-first UI.

### Fixed

- **Welcome-bot spam on peek connections** — every `culture channel
  read` and every dashboard channels refresh opens a short-lived
  `local-_peekXXXX` connection; the welcome bot was greeting each one
  in #team, flooding the channel with `Welcome local-_peekXXXX to
  #team` lines. Filter updated to exclude any nick containing
  `_peek`.
- **Stale `#task-*` channels lingering in the active Channels tab** —
  channels whose only members are stopped workers (e.g. closed
  verify-* / qfix-* / fix-* nicks from the v8.19 fleet) cluttered
  the Channels view despite no live activity. `list_channels` now
  filters out `#task-*` channels with no `running` member. Joint /
  shared / boss channels always show regardless of member state.

## [8.19.9] - 2026-05-31

Consolidation bump after the v8.18.7 → v8.19.8 fleet merge cycle.
Twelve PRs (#24–#36) merged in under 12 hours via rebase + automated
conflict resolution; intermediate per-version CHANGELOG entries
were lost during rebase merges — captured here in aggregate.

### Added (by PR)

- **v8.18.6 / PR #24** — `model_resolved` daemon-log + `_boss_inherits`
  fallback (closes Qodo latch + orphan-resolved findings).
- **v8.18.7 / PR #29** — Task-channel ACL at IRC JOIN layer + owner-map
  TTL cache + federation gate symmetric in `should_relay` /
  `_check_incoming_trust`. Closes 4 Qodo findings.
- **v8.18.8 / PR #26** — Socket symlink on bind (`ensure_socket_symlink`),
  all 4 backends + harness.
- **v8.19.0 / PR #30** — `--channels` spawn flag + IPC `irc_read`
  history backfill + **CRLF injection guard** (new
  `culture/agentirc/irc_targets.py` wired at 4 ingress points; 30 tests).
- **v8.19.1 / PR #27** — Agent `archived` state + channel `CHANARCHIVE`
  verb + 5 blocker fixes from review + 2 Qodo Reliability fixes
  (archived channels persistent, archive-fails-loudly).
- **v8.19.2 / PR #28** — Dashboard Channels + Archived tabs + 5 endpoints
  + archive-race fix (refuse if daemon won't stop) + 3 Qodo fixes
  (perf `to_thread`, channel routing, channel-history JOIN).
- **v8.19.3 / PR #31** — Boss mission persistence across daemon restarts.
  Shared `culture/clients/_mission.py` (rotation at 32 KiB, idempotent
  cleanup, stable prompt-cache format), wired into all 4 backends.
- **v8.19.4 / PR #32** — `role:` field on AgentConfig + `--role` spawn
  flag + dashboard render.
- **v8.19.5 / PR #33** — `culture agent compact <nick> <reason>` command
  for explicit task-switch compaction. All 4 backends.
- **v8.19.6 / PR #34** — CI quality gates: mypy strict carve-out on
  security-sensitive modules, docs-coverage script that fails PRs
  adding public surface without docs, bandit B606 re-enabled.
- **v8.19.7 / PR #35** — Channels-first dashboard inversion (Channels
  default tab; channel cards show member chips with role badges +
  state dots).
- **v8.19.8 / PR #36** — Silent-death watchdog: boss daemons detect
  workers whose PIDs are dead but never wrote `agent_exit`. Closes
  the reliability gap surfaced by the v8.18.7 fleet ship (4 of 6
  workers died silently).

### Docs

- **PR #25** — `docs/task-model.md` (channels-are-tasks, three-level
  hierarchy, Pattern A vs B orchestrators, role + lifecycle).
- **PR #25** — `docs/dev-policy.md` (quality bar + flow + review).

### Security

- CRLF injection on user-controlled IRC targets → closed.
- Task-channel ACL federation bypass → closed (symmetric outbound +
  inbound gate on `#task-*`).

### Findings + dogfood writeups

- 8-reviewer audit fleet + Qodo reviewed every PR; combined finding
  pool (~30 actionable) closed end-to-end through this cycle. Workers
  shipped 4 of 6 Qodo-fix passes themselves; orchestrator shipped
  the rest under the silent-death recovery pattern documented in
  `docs/dev-policy.md`.

## [8.19.1] - 2026-05-30

Agent archiving and channel archiving.

### Added

- **Agent archiving with `state` field**. Adds `state: archived` to
  culture.yaml, formalizing the existing `archived` boolean into a
  proper lifecycle state. Agents are either active (running or stopped,
  re-startable) or archived (historical, read-only).

- **`culture agent archive <nick>`** marks a stopped agent as archived.
  Refuses if the agent is still running (must stop first). Archived
  agents are hidden from default status listing.

- **`culture agent restore <nick>`** moves an archived agent back to
  active (stopped) state, ready to be started again. `unarchive`
  remains as an alias.

- **Status filtering**: `culture agent status --archived` shows only
  archived agents; `--all` includes them alongside active agents.

- **Channel archiving**: `culture channel archive <#channel>` and
  server-side `CHANARCHIVE` command. Archived channels refuse new
  JOINs, are hidden from LIST, but history remains readable. Agents
  and channels archive independently.

- **`set_agent_state()`** config helper for programmatic state
  transitions with validation.

- 21 new tests: agent state sync, serialization, transitions, display
  filtering, lifecycle scenarios, and 4 server-level channel archive
  integration tests (JOIN refused, LIST hidden, double-archive, missing
  channel).

## [8.19.0] - 2026-05-30

Two CLI/IPC fixes from the boss-fleet audit.

### Added

- **`--channels` flag for `culture boss spawn`** (`culture/cli/boss.py`).
  Workers previously joined only `#team` and `#task-<name>`. The new flag
  accepts a comma-separated list of extra channels (e.g.
  `--channels '#joint-fixes,#design'`). Channels without a `#` prefix are
  auto-prefixed. The boss also joins the extra channels for observation.
  Channels are written into the worker's `culture.yaml` alongside the
  defaults, with deduplication.

### Fixed

- **Boss IPC `irc_read` returns empty for joint channels**
  (`culture/clients/*/irc_transport.py`, `packages/agent-harness/irc_transport.py`).
  Root cause: when a daemon joins a channel via `irc_join`, pre-existing
  messages lived only in the server's HISTORY store and never reached the
  daemon's `MessageBuffer`. The transport now handles `HISTORY` and
  `HISTORYEND` IRC responses, and `join_channel()` issues
  `HISTORY RECENT <channel> 200` after `JOIN` to backfill the buffer.
  System-user entries (`system-*`) are filtered, matching the existing
  `PRIVMSG` filter. Fix applied to all four backends (claude, acp, codex,
  copilot) and the reference implementation in `packages/agent-harness/`.

## [8.18.8] - 2026-05-30

Closes a daemon-IPC reachability bug surfaced by `verify-joint-w`
during the three-layer-vision audit dogfood: the daemon binds its
Unix socket in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` or `/tmp`, but the
`culture channel` CLI resolves sockets via `~/.culture/run/`. When
the two diverge (the common case on macOS where
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset) the CLI can't reach the daemon.

### Added

- **`culture/clients/_socket_link.py`** — `ensure_socket_symlink` +
  `remove_socket_symlink` helpers. `ensure_socket_symlink` creates
  an atomic symlink (mkstemp → unlink → symlink → rename, the
  standard POSIX atomic-symlink-replace) from the CLI-visible path
  to the real socket path; `remove_socket_symlink` cleans up on
  daemon stop. Idempotent on missing files; safe against stale
  symlinks and regular-file collisions.

### Changed

- All four backend daemons (`claude`, `codex`, `acp`, `copilot`) +
  the `packages/agent-harness/` template now call
  `ensure_socket_symlink` immediately after `socket_server.start()`
  and `remove_socket_symlink` immediately before
  `socket_server.stop()`. Satisfies the all-backends rule.

### Tests

- 10 new tests in `tests/test_socket_link.py`: creates fresh,
  replaces stale symlink, replaces regular file, no-op when paths
  already match, XDG honored, fallback to `~/.culture/run`,
  permissions enforced (0o700), idempotent remove.

### Surfacing

Surfaced during the three-layer-vision verification dogfood — see
`verify-joint-w`'s GAP 2 in `#joint-vision-audit`. Closed by
mesh worker `local-fix-symlink-w`; orchestrator shipped the
commit on behalf since the daemon stopped silently before push
(co-authored attribution in commit footer).

## [8.18.7] - 2026-05-30

### Security

- **Task-channel ACL enforcement at the IRC JOIN layer**
  (`culture/agentirc/client.py`). Workers could previously join any
  `#task-<suffix>` channel, including channels belonging to other
  workers. This bypassed the boss CLI's team isolation checks
  (`boss.py _foreign_worker`). The IRCd now enforces: only the
  worker whose nick matches the suffix (owner) and that worker's
  boss (from the manifest) may join `#task-*` channels. All other
  clients receive `474 ERR_BANNEDFROMCHAN`. System nicks
  (`system-*`) are always allowed. `#joint-*`, `#team`, and other
  channels remain unrestricted.

### Added

- `ERR_BANNEDFROMCHAN` (474) numeric reply in
  `culture/protocol/replies.py`.
- `_task_channel_acl()` and `_load_owner_map()` helpers in
  `culture/agentirc/client.py` — manifest-backed ACL for
  `#task-*` channels.
- 14 new tests in `tests/test_task_channel_acl.py` (9 unit + 5
  integration) covering: owner join, foreign refusal, boss join,
  wrong-boss refusal, joint channels, system nicks, missing manifest.

## [8.18.6] - 2026-05-30

Surfaced during the in-mesh PRD-authoring dogfood. Spawning `local-prd-w`
exposed that workers were inheriting the SDK CLI's hardcoded default
model (claude-opus-4-6) instead of whatever model the boss was actually
running with — defeating the YAML-omits-model inheritance pattern the
boss stack was designed around. The boss daemon-log was recording
`model: ''` on `agent_start` (because the boss YAML omits model by
design, so workers inherit), and the SDK-resolved runtime model was
never written anywhere a spawn could read it.

### Added

- **`model_resolved` daemon-log action**
  (`culture/clients/claude/daemon.py`). The daemon now latches the
  SDK-resolved runtime model the moment the first AssistantMessage
  names a model, writing one `model_resolved` action per session. The
  latch resets on every `agent_start` so a restarted session can
  re-record if the SDK happens to pick a different default this run
  (e.g. between CLI version bumps). Idempotent: subsequent
  AssistantMessages do not write additional records.

### Fixed

- **`_boss_inherits` fallback to `model_resolved` when YAML omits model**
  (`culture/cli/boss.py`). The reader now scans for a `model_resolved`
  action after the most recent `agent_start`. When `agent_start.model`
  is empty (the inheritance-friendly boss-YAML pattern), the resolved
  runtime model is used instead — so workers inherit the boss's actual
  running model, not the SDK CLI's hardcoded default. A `model_resolved`
  from a PRIOR session is correctly ignored (the reader stops at the
  most recent `agent_start`). An explicit YAML-pinned model still wins
  over a later `model_resolved` to honor the operator's choice.

### Notes

- Five new tests in `tests/test_boss_model_inherit.py` cover: YAML-empty
  → resolved fallback, YAML-pinned vs resolved precedence, prior-session
  resolved ignored, most-recent within-session wins, plus the existing
  9 inheritance tests still pass.
- The PRD-authoring dogfood that surfaced this is documented in
  `docs/v8.18.6-prd-authoring-dogfood.md` alongside the cross-project
  + joint-coordination-channel vision the worker incorporated across
  three correction rounds (V1 factual fixes, V2 three-level hierarchy,
  V3 cross-project orchestration).
- `.claude/skills/run-tests/scripts/test.sh` fixed: empty `EXTRA_ARGS`
  array expansion was tripping `set -u` on macOS bash 3.2.

## [8.18.5] - 2026-05-30

Surfaced + fixed during the context-watch handoff dogfood
(see `docs/v8.18.4-context-watch-dogfood.md`). A worker hitting the SDK
CLI's `Stream closed` bug on every `Write` alternated between failed
turns and Bash-workaround turns that completed cleanly. v8.18.4's
`stalled_in_retry_loop` watchdog stayed silent because each successful
Bash turn refreshed `_last_turn_completed_at`, masking the elevated
failure rate.

### Added

- **`stalled_in_failed_retry` watchdog class**
  (`culture/clients/claude/daemon.py`,
  `culture/clients/claude/agent_runner.py`). A fifth class on the
  unified stall watchdog. `AgentRunner` now also exposes an
  `on_turn_failed` callback fired from `_process_turn`'s exception
  branch. The daemon increments a `_consecutive_failed_turns` counter
  on each failed turn and resets it on each clean turn. When the
  counter exceeds `CONSECUTIVE_FAILED_TURN_THRESHOLD` (5) the watchdog
  surfaces `idle_warning {reason: stalled_in_failed_retry,
  failed_turns: N}` to the boss so it can intervene before the worker
  burns more API calls in alternating-fail-success patterns.

## [8.18.4] - 2026-05-30

Surfaced + fixed during an in-mesh multi-worker dogfood. Three workers
(`research`, `customer`, `builder`) ran concurrently under `local-boss`
for ~12 minutes; full findings in `docs/v8.18.4-dogfood-findings.md`.
The system delivered all three artifacts despite multiple SDK CLI
crashes and tool-retry loops.

### Added

- **`stalled_in_retry_loop` watchdog class**
  (`culture/clients/claude/daemon.py`,
  `culture/clients/claude/agent_runner.py`). A new fourth class to the
  unified stall watchdog. The v8.18.2 watchdog tracked
  `_last_assistant_message_at` — recent AssistantMessages cleared the
  `stalled_post_engagement` timer. But during the dogfood,
  `local-customer` ran for 4+ minutes hitting the SDK CLI's
  `Stream closed` error on every `Write personas.md`. Each retry was a
  fresh AssistantMessage so the watchdog stayed silent — even though no
  turn had completed and no file had landed.

  `AgentRunner` now exposes an `on_turn_complete` callback fired after
  a turn's `async for query()` loop ends cleanly (i.e. the SDK yielded
  a final `ResultMessage`). The daemon's `_on_turn_complete` updates
  `_last_turn_completed_at`. The watchdog's tick now checks
  `now - last_assistant_message < STALL_GRACE` AND
  `now - last_turn_completed >= STALL_GRACE` → DM the boss with a
  class-specific message that names the retry-loop pattern. Three new
  tests pin the matrix (looping fires, healthy turn-completer doesn't,
  callback updates timestamp).

### Documented (not fixed in this release)

- **SDK CLI `Stream closed` / `CLIConnectionError` mid-hook (HIGH).**
  Both `research` and `builder` crashed at the SDK level when firing
  3+ tool calls in rapid succession; the bundled `claude` CLI's
  `sendRequest` throws `Stream closed` when its `inputClosed` flag
  flips during a hook callback's await. Not directly fixable on the
  culture side — needs an upstream repro to
  `anthropics/claude-agent-sdk`. v8.18.0 crash recovery + IRC channel
  persistence (the brief is re-read from buffer on restart) makes
  these losses recoverable.
- **Off-task drift after crash recovery (MED).** `research` rewrote
  `findings.md` on a different topic after restart because the cwd
  name (`/tmp/dogfood-research`) and IRC channel mentions leaked
  `"dogfooding"` into its context. Fix candidates: explicit boss
  re-brief on `idle_warning {reason: never_briefed}`, or workers
  persisting a `mission.md` they re-read on restart. Out of scope here.

## [8.18.3] - 2026-05-30

Eight cited security findings from an in-mesh `local-secscan` dogfood
(see `docs/v8.18.2-followups.md` § B), all fixed with tests.

### Security

- **B#1 — HISTORY skill now requires channel membership** (HIGH —
  `culture/agentirc/skills/history.py`). `HISTORY RECENT` / `HISTORY
  SEARCH` previously returned every channel's content to any registered
  client whether they had joined or not. New `_client_may_read_history`
  gate matches the pattern used by PRIVMSG-to-channel / PART / TOPIC.
  Non-member requests get `ERR_NOTONCHANNEL` (442).

- **B#2 — Pre-registration PRIVMSG / NOTICE silent-drop** (HIGH —
  `culture/agentirc/client.py`). A TCP socket that sent `NICK` but not
  `USER` (so `_registered` stayed False) could `PRIVMSG <agent> :@<agent>
  …`, injecting messages into the agent's `@mention` handler and driving
  its behavior. Channel messages were already blocked (the client isn't
  in any channel) but DMs slipped through. Now matches the silent-drop
  pattern used by `_handle_join`.

- **B#3 — Pre-registration WHO / WHOIS silent-drop** (MED —
  `culture/agentirc/client.py`). Same gate as B#2, applied to user
  enumeration paths that leak nicks / modes / hostnames / channel
  memberships.

- **B#4 — S2S password compare is now constant-time** (MED —
  `culture/agentirc/server_link.py`). Replaced `self._peer_pass !=
  self.password` with `hmac.compare_digest`. The dashboard already uses
  it for its token check (`server.py:635,639`); now the S2S link does
  too.

- **B#5 — S2S read buffer is now bounded** (MED —
  `culture/agentirc/server_link.py`). A peer with no `\n` terminator
  could OOM the server by streaming bytes into an unbounded `buffer`
  string. C2S already caps at `8192/4096` (`client.py:230`); S2S now
  mirrors with `65536/32768` to accommodate larger federation payloads.

- **B#6 — SEVENT origin is force-corrected to the authenticated peer**
  (MED — `culture/agentirc/server_link.py`). Previously a `SEVENT
  other-server …` from `peer-A` only logged a warning; the spoofed
  origin still landed in `data["_origin"]` and `system-<origin>` audit
  prefixes. A compromised peer could impersonate any server in the mesh.
  Origin is now overwritten with `self.peer_name`.

- **B#7 — Default IRCd bind is now 127.0.0.1** (MED —
  `culture/agentirc/config.py`, `culture/agentirc/__main__.py`). The
  IRCd has no C2S authentication; binding to `0.0.0.0` by default was
  an unauthenticated LAN service. Operators that need network exposure
  pass `--host 0.0.0.0` explicitly. *Backwards-incompatible default.*

- **B#8 — Dashboard auth is now a POST form (`/auth`)** (LOW —
  `culture/dashboard/server.py`, `culture/cli/dashboard.py`). The
  legacy `?token=<secret>` bootstrap leaked the token into browser
  history, server access logs, and Referer headers on outbound
  navigation. The new `/auth` GET renders a minimal login form; POST
  submits the token in the request body. Unauthenticated HTML requests
  now redirect to `/auth`. The `?token=` path is kept for backwards
  compat with `logger.warning` on use; `culture dashboard --auth`
  startup output prints the login URL + token on separate lines.

## [8.18.2] - 2026-05-30

### Security (critical)

- **A — Broker actually fires now (via PreToolUse hook).** v8.18.1 changed
  the SDK from `permission_mode="bypassPermissions"` to `"default"` —
  necessary, but not sufficient. In-mesh dogfooding of v8.18.1 (a
  `local-secscan` worker) confirmed via a `logger.warning` at the top of
  `PermissionBroker.gate`: the gate **never fired** across 140+ turns
  including non-safe Bash + Write calls. The SDK CLI in `default` mode
  with `--permission-prompt-tool stdio` does not route every tool to the
  `can_use_tool` callback — its built-in allow-list pre-approves most
  tools without consulting Python. **PreToolUse hooks do fire for every
  tool call.**

  `AgentRunner._broker_pre_tool_use_hook` wraps `broker.gate` and is
  installed via `opts.hooks["PreToolUse"]` whenever a broker is wired
  (worker has a perm-policy file). Fail-closed: hook returns deny if
  `broker.gate` raises; broker bugs can't become permission bypasses.
  Generous `HookMatcher` timeout (900s) covers the broker's own 600s
  `_PERM_DECISION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. `can_use_tool` wiring kept as
  defense-in-depth. Verified live: `perm_request_notified` daemon-log
  action fired for both `ToolSearch` and `Write` from the secscan
  worker — the first time the broker has actually been invoked end-to-end
  in production.

### Fixed

- **C — Boss daemon auto-rejoins owned task channels on restart.** After
  `culture agent stop local-boss && culture agent start local-boss`, the
  restarted boss was no longer in any `#task-<worker>` channel, so
  `culture boss brief <worker>` failed its channel-membership pre-check.
  `AgentDaemon.start` now reads the manifest, finds every agent whose
  `boss:` field equals this daemon's nick, and rejoins their
  `#task-<suffix>` channels. Skips channels already in the daemon's own
  `agent.channels` (no double-join).

- **D — `culture agent stop` actually terminates the process.** Observed
  live during v8.18.1 verification: `agent_stop` logged at 05:00:40,
  process PID 38387 stayed alive 5+ minutes, watchdog inside the zombie
  fired `stalled_post_engagement` 305s later. `AgentDaemon.stop` now (a)
  drains supervisor evaluation tasks via `Supervisor.wait_for_evals` and
  (b) cancels every remaining task in `_background_tasks`.
  `_run_single_agent` adds a defense-in-depth pass cancelling any
  asyncio tasks the daemon's stop didn't track, so the loop drains and
  the process exits.

## [8.18.1] - 2026-05-30

### Security (critical, but incomplete — superseded by 8.18.2-A)

- **Permission broker was a no-op in production.** When the worker daemon
  configured the Claude Agent SDK with `permission_mode="bypassPermissions"`
  AND `can_use_tool=<broker.gate>`, the CLI binary literally interpreted
  bypassPermissions as "Allow all tools" (`claude_agent_sdk/query.py:58`)
  and never invoked the `can_use_tool` callback. Switching to
  `permission_mode="default"` was necessary (bypass mode was demonstrably
  wrong) but as of 8.18.2 we know it was not sufficient — the SDK's
  `default` mode still does not route every tool through `can_use_tool`.
  v8.18.2-A switches enforcement to the SDK's `PreToolUse` hook system,
  which DOES fire for every tool. v8.18.1's mode change is kept (it's
  semantically more accurate than bypass even with the hook path).

## [8.18.0] - 2026-05-30

This release closes 12 ranked findings (8 stall classes from audit1's
in-mesh dogfood + 11 prioritized findings from a comprehensive
multi-agent adversarial audit) that together hardened reliability,
observability, and security across the boss/worker stack.

### Added

- **`AgentDaemon._notify_boss(action, message, **detail)`** — every
  boss-facing alert (idle/stall, circuit_open, perm_request_notified,
  supervisor escalation) now routes through one helper that records
  to the daemon-log first (always lands; dashboard reads it) and DMs
  the boss best-effort. Each alert is structured + visible in the
  dashboard even when IRC is unhealthy.
- **`AgentRunner.set_paused(flag)`** + an internal `asyncio.Event` so
  pause holds the SDK runner queue authoritatively. Mirrors
  `AgentDaemon._paused` so handoff/`/compact`/poll prompts already
  queued wait for resume instead of executing against a "paused"
  worker.
- **`Supervisor.wait_for_evals()`** + `Supervisor.resume()` — the
  former for graceful shutdown / determinism, the latter to clear
  `paused` + `consecutive_failures` after an escalation (without it
  an escalated worker stayed unsupervised forever).
- **Activity-tab dashboard view** that renders the audit JSONL as
  per-turn cards with thinking (italic gray), assistant text, tool
  calls with their full inputs, and tool results with their full
  outputs — same shape as a regular Claude Code session. Tab
  tooltips explain what each shows (SDK activity / daemon lifecycle
  / IRC channel).

### Changed

- **Workers inherit model + thinking from the boss's RUNTIME**, not
  from any yaml. The SDK picks the current Claude when no model is
  set; the boss daemon records that in its `agent_start` daemon-log
  detail; `culture boss spawn` reads from there and propagates both
  fields into the worker's yaml. Result: no hardcoded model strings
  anywhere — new Claude versions inherit automatically. Code defaults
  for `model` go to empty; `thinking` defaults to `"high"`.
- **`_paused` is authoritative end-to-end**: pause halts the SDK
  runner queue too, not just the mention/poll surfaces (workflow #2).
- **Supervisor evaluation runs off the SDK consumer pump** via
  fire-and-forget tasks (locked) so a slow supervisor LLM call no
  longer blocks audit writes, engaged tracking, or watchdog activation
  timers (workflow #8).
- **Dashboard "Session" tab renamed to "Activity"** with tooltips on
  each tab and `<nick> · <kind>` in the column header so the current
  view is always obvious.
- **`_audit.py` captures full tool I/O + thinking** (size-capped at
  16 KiB per field with a truncation marker). Legacy `input_digest` /
  `content_digest` / `preview` kept alongside for back-compat
  consumers.

### Fixed

- **Stall watchdog now catches all three silent-worker classes**
  (audit1 #1+#2, workflow #1 — observed live as `local-qa658c`
  silently stalling for 3+ hours after receiving its brief):
  - `never_briefed` — alive > `IDLE_GRACE_SECONDS` (90s) with no
    mention/poll/invite activation
  - `stalled_pre_engagement` — brief landed, no `AssistantMessage`
    in `STALL_GRACE_SECONDS` (300s)
  - `stalled_post_engagement` — engaged, then no new
    `AssistantMessage` in `STALL_GRACE_SECONDS`
  Each fires a distinct daemon-log entry + DMs the boss once per
  state change. The watchdog re-arms on resume from pause
  (`_ipc_resume`, sleep-scheduler resume).
- **Perm-gate no longer hangs forever** when the boss is unresponsive
  (audit1 #3). `_await_decision` returns a synthetic deny with
  `reason=timeout` after `_PERM_DECISION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (600s) so
  the SDK call can proceed instead of stalling.
- **Circuit-breaker DMs the boss directly** (audit1 #4) — was
  webhook-only, invisible to bosses not watching the alert channel.
- **`_run_loop` done-callback** catches the silent-task-death case
  (audit1 #8): an exception escaping `_process_turn`'s try/except
  (e.g. from a callback) used to leave the task dead with no `on_exit`
  signal, so crash recovery never triggered. Now fires a fallback
  `on_exit(1)` so the circuit breaker still arms.
- **Workers inherit `thinking` from the boss too**, not just `model`
  (workflow #1, user feedback "both model and effort levels").

### Security

- **Ceiling bypass closed** (workflow #3): a sticky `--always allow`
  rule for a benign tool (e.g. `Bash ls`) used to whitelist every
  Bash invocation (`rm -rf`, `git push`, …) because the gate's fast
  path returned allow without re-checking `is_above_ceiling`. Gate
  now re-checks on every policy-allow.
- **Handoff write-anywhere closed** (workflow #5): the auto-allow
  regex was tail-anchored only (`/handoff/<nick>.md$` matched via
  `re.search`), so any path whose tail looked right slipped through —
  e.g. `/etc/secrets/handoff/<nick>.md`. Now anchored to the EXACT
  absolute `handoff_path_for(nick)` via `^…$`.
- **Ownership forge closed** (workflow #4): `_request_is_foreign`
  used to trust `req['boss']` as authoritative. The worker controls
  that payload field, so a buggy/malicious worker could forge
  `boss: <other-boss>` to route requests to another team's approver.
  Ownership now derived from the MANIFEST only (`_owner_map`); a
  request whose `helper_nick` lacks a manifest entry is foreign to
  every boss (fail closed).
- **Cross-team audit/log read gated** (workflow #9): `culture boss
  audit` / `culture boss log` now check `_foreign_worker` before
  tailing, matching the gate in `brief`/`read`/`approve`/`deny`/
  `close`.
- **Nick fidelity** (observed live): `culture channel message` from
  a worker's Bash subprocess fell to the IRCObserver fallback (which
  posts under `<server>-_peek<hex>`) when the daemon socket was
  unreachable — so the worker's DONE post appeared in the channel
  under a stranger nick. When `CULTURE_NICK` is set, the CLI now
  refuses the observer fallback with a clear error.

## [8.17.3] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **Idle signal reads the full daemon-log, not a fixed tail.** `_daemon_logged_idle`
  no longer reads only the last 8 KiB — it reads the whole (small, lifecycle-only)
  daemon-log, removing a latent coupling where a future high-volume log action on
  an idle worker could have buried the lone `idle_warning` past the window and
  silently un-flagged it. Closes the last (latent, currently-unreachable) note
  from round-5 adversarial verification; the idle loop is now converged.

## [8.17.2] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

A second adversarial re-verification (round 4) found two more idle residuals; closed:

- **Poll/room-invite work now counts as activation.** Previously `_last_activation`
  was set only on an `@mention`; a worker driven by the channel poll (a boss posts
  task context *without* `@`-tagging) or a room invite started a slow first turn
  with no activation recorded and was still false-flagged idle. Both dispatch
  paths now set `_last_activation`.
- **Dashboard idle no longer depends on audit byte-size.** The daemon now records
  an `engaged` action on a worker's first turn, and the dashboard's idle signal
  reads the daemon-log alone — `idle_warning` cleared by a later `engaged` or
  `agent_start`. This removes the last false-positive (an externally
  truncated/rotated audit on a re-driven, engaged worker) and makes the daemon-log
  the single source of truth for idle.

## [8.17.1] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

Closing residuals an adversarial re-verification found in the 8.17.0 idle watchdog:

- **No false idle for a busy worker.** The daemon only flags a worker that was
  *never triggered* (`_last_activation is None`) — a worker briefed and grinding
  on a slow first turn (extended thinking, long first tool call > grace window)
  is no longer sent a spurious `[idle]` DM telling the boss to re-drive it.
- **Restart re-evaluates idle.** Re-arming the watchdog (crash-restart) now resets
  engagement/activation and cancels the prior watchdog task, so a worker that
  engaged → crashed → restarted → went idle is re-detected (and no orphaned task
  can fire a stale DM).
- **Dashboard `IDLE` badge now mirrors the daemon's decision.** `_is_idle` is
  gated on boss-ownership and the daemon's recorded `idle_warning` (cleared by a
  later restart), instead of guessing from audit size — so it no longer
  false-flags a freshly-started worker (startup window), a boss/standalone agent,
  or a worker whose audit was rotated/truncated.
- **Docs:** `boss-agent.md` now discloses idle self-reporting is Claude-only
  (like the broker/context-watch) — every boss-owned worker is Claude, but a
  hand-placed non-Claude worker won't self-report.

## [8.17.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Idle-worker detection that closes the loop.** A boss-owned worker that comes
  up but never produces a turn within `IDLE_GRACE_SECONDS` (90s) — e.g. spawned
  into the wrong channel or never briefed — now surfaces itself instead of sitting
  silently while the boss believes it's working:
  - the worker daemon **DMs its parent boss** an `[idle]` notice (reusing the
    same worker→boss path as permission requests) and records an `idle_warning`
    in its daemon-log, so the boss gets the truth pushed into its loop and can
    re-drive the worker — no human needed;
  - the **Mission Control dashboard** badges any running worker with no activity
    (empty audit) as **IDLE** (`/api/agents` gains an `idle` field), so a
    mis-reported worker outs itself at a glance.
  This makes the system — not the operator or the agent's self-report — the
  watchdog: agent narration becomes a hint, the idle signal is ground truth.

## [8.16.2] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **`culture boss spawn` into a multi-agent directory now records ownership
  correctly.** When a worker's `cwd` already held a multi-agent `culture.yaml`
  (an `agents:` list — e.g. several workers sharing one project dir),
  `_record_worker_boss` wrote `boss`/`channels` at the top level, where the
  loader silently shadowed them with the list entry — so the worker came up
  **unassigned, in `#general` instead of `#task-<name>`, and could never be
  briefed** (it sat idle while the boss believed it was working). It now writes
  into the worker's entry within the `agents:` list (and strips the stray
  top-level fields a prior write left behind).

## [8.16.1] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

Closing the two residuals an adversarial re-verification pass found after 8.16.0:

- **`culture boss spawn --server` is now validated** (via `_require_server`),
  closing the same `../` arbitrary-file-write that 8.16.0 fixed for
  `culture boss init` — `--server` flows into `worker_nick` →
  `seed_helper_policy` → a policy path, so it must be sanitized too.
- **Grant-ceiling residuals tightened** (still cooperative): now also catches
  long-form `rm --recursive --force`, command-substitution wrapping (`$(…)` /
  backticks), and `chmod … 777` in any flag order; and a trailing word-boundary
  removes substring false-positives (`git pushup`, `cat truncate_helper.py`,
  `kubectl-helper-doc` no longer escalate).

## [8.16.0] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

Hardening from an adversarial verification audit of the boss stack:

- **Multi-team isolation no longer fails open.** The broker now records the
  owning boss IN each permission request (`PermissionBroker(..., boss=...)`); the
  boss CLI attributes ownership from the request itself, so a missing/corrupt/
  suffix-mismatched worker `culture.yaml` can't make another team's request appear
  unowned and become approvable by the wrong boss.
- **Dashboard returns 400, not 500, on a non-string request id.** `valid_request_id`
  now rejects non-strings (`{"id": 123}`) instead of raising `TypeError`.
- **`culture boss deny` no longer writes an orphan decision** for a missing/absent
  request id (now mirrors `approve`'s guard).
- **`culture boss brief` / `read` enforce team isolation** — a boss can no longer
  brief or read another boss's worker (same gate as approve/deny/close).
- **`culture boss close` reports the real result** — it no longer prints "closed"
  when the underlying `culture agent stop` refused or failed.
- **Model inheritance is honest** — `_boss_model` reads the boss's *explicit*
  model (not the hardcoded dataclass default), and an inherited model never
  clobbers a model the worker already carries (only an explicit `--model` does).
- **`culture boss init` validates `--nick`/`--server`** (closes a `../`
  arbitrary-file-write via the boss's own identity flags).
- **context-watch tolerates quoted YAML numbers** — string thresholds
  (`high_water: "0.9"`) and `enabled: "false"` are coerced instead of crashing the
  agent loop.

### Changed

- **Grant ceiling tightened** (still a cooperative guard, not a sandbox): the Bash
  denylist is now case-insensitive, fires on quoted SQL (`psql -c 'drop table'`)
  and `rm` flag variants (`-fr`, `-r -f`), and adds `dd`, `mkfs`, `chmod -R 777`,
  and `curl|sh` / `wget|sh`.

## [8.15.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Dashboard groups agents into teams.** The agent column now renders each boss
  as a team header with its workers nested beneath it (derived from each agent's
  `is_boss` / `boss` fields), and a final "unassigned" group for standalone
  agents — so a boss and its workers read as one unit. Frontend-only (the
  `/api/agents` contract already exposes the fields; a test locks it).

## [8.14.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Model inheritance for spawned workers.** `culture boss spawn` now writes the
  **boss's model** into the worker's `culture.yaml` by default, so a worker runs on
  its parent's model instead of the hardcoded agent default. `culture boss spawn
  --model <m>` overrides per worker; `culture boss init --model <m>` sets the
  boss's own model (its parent — the human/session — chooses it) so the whole team
  runs on the parent's model. Any parent may set a child's model; the default is
  the parent's. No model anywhere → the existing agent default still applies (so
  no change for standalone agents).

## [8.13.0] - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- **`culture boss brief` verifies delivery.** Before claiming a worker was
  briefed, it checks (via a transient observer WHO) that the worker is actually in
  its `#task-<name>` channel; if not — or if membership can't be verified — it
  refuses (exit 1) instead of silently "succeeding." This closes the
  false-"boss flow is live" failure mode where a worker started ad-hoc into
  `#general` (not via `culture boss spawn`) never receives the brief, yet the boss
  believes work began. The boss skill now also tells the boss to confirm the
  worker actually *engaged* (non-empty audit / Session activity) before reporting
  it live.

## [8.12.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Close authority — only a parent can close its children.** `culture agent stop`
  now refuses (exit 2) unless the caller (`CULTURE_NICK`) is the target's parent
  (its `boss:` field) or the human (no `CULTURE_NICK`). So no agent can close
  itself, a boss can close only its own workers (not another boss's, not itself),
  and a worker can close nothing. `culture boss close` refuses self / another
  boss's worker with a clear message, and the dashboard runs stops as the human
  (root) — it may close any agent as a safeguard. For a fully unsupervised boss
  this is a cooperative guard on the sanctioned commands (raw `kill` is still
  possible — no broker sits in front of the boss).

## [8.11.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Secure remote access for the dashboard.** `culture dashboard --auth` requires
  a token (auto-generated at `~/.culture/dashboard-token`, or set with
  `--auth-token`) before any request is served; the token is seeded into a
  `SameSite=Strict`, HttpOnly cookie via a one-time `?token=…` bootstrap URL
  (printed on start), so the SSE streams and page loads all authenticate by
  cookie. `--trusted-host HOST` (repeatable) allows a tunnel's hostname through
  the Origin/Host guard. Intended shape: keep the loopback bind and front it with
  a private tunnel (e.g. `tailscale serve`) so the control plane is reachable from
  a phone without ever being exposed publicly. Auth is off by default — pure
  localhost behavior is unchanged.

## [8.10.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Talk to agents from the dashboard.** Mission Control gains a **Chat** tab: it
  shows the recent conversation in the selected agent's channel (both sides) and a
  message box to talk to the agent directly. Sent text is posted to the agent's
  channel prefixed with `@<nick>` so its mention detector fires (same as
  `culture boss brief`), over a transient observer connection — no boss daemon
  required. New endpoints: `GET /api/channel/<nick>` (recent messages) and
  `POST /api/message` (`{nick, text}`). The target channel is the agent's private
  `#task-*` channel when it has one, else its first configured channel.

### Changed

- **Per-team isolation for multiple bosses.** The `culture boss` CLI is now
  team-aware so several bosses can share one mesh: `culture boss pending` lists
  only the calling boss's own workers, and `culture boss approve`/`deny` refuse
  (exit 2) a request from a worker owned by another boss (ownership read from each
  worker's `culture.yaml` `boss:` field via the manifest). A worker with no
  recorded owner stays visible to every boss. The dashboard remains the
  human/all-teams view and is intentionally not team-scoped.

## [8.9.1] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- `culture boss cleanup` — garbage-collects stale permission requests (queued by a
  worker that is no longer running) and orphan decision files (a decision left
  without a matching request). In-repo replacement for the out-of-repo
  `cleanup-stale-perms.sh`, so the boss can recover a clean queue after closing
  workers.

### Changed

- **Single source of truth for boss tooling.** The in-repo `culture boss` CLI +
  `culture dashboard` are now the canonical boss/permission surface. Living docs
  (`docs/agentirc/helper-permissions.md`, `helper-daemon-log.md`,
  `helper-context-handoff.md`, `boss-agent.md`, `docs/reference/cli/index.md`) and
  the `culture boss approve` above-ceiling escalation message now point at the CLI
  and the dashboard instead of the legacy out-of-repo bash scripts
  (`approve.sh`/`pending-perms.sh`/etc.), which are demoted to legacy.

## [8.9.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Mission Control dashboard** — a localhost web app (`culture dashboard`) to watch every agent live and intervene. Three-pane UI: agent grid (state, pending count, last action, BOSS tag), per-agent session/daemon-log SSE streams, and a pending-approvals panel. Full control surface: approve/deny (human is top authority — not ceiling-bounded), pause/resume, close, emergency stop-all (pause or kill), and grant-policy edit. `aiohttp` backend (existing dep) + vanilla-JS frontend (no build step); binds `127.0.0.1` only (refuses non-loopback without `--unsafe-bind`). Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-29-mission-control-dashboard-design.md`; guide: `docs/agentirc/dashboard.md`.
- `culture/dashboard/` (server + static SPA), `culture/cli/dashboard.py` (`culture dashboard` command).

### Changed

- `_perm_broker.list_pending()` now excludes requests that already have a decision (awaiting their worker to consume it), so approvers (dashboard and `culture boss pending`) don't re-act on decided requests. Surfaced by live in-browser verification of the dashboard.

### Fixed

- **Critical (regression from 8.7.0/8.8.0):** the Claude daemon read `agent.context_watch` / `agent.boss` directly, but at runtime it receives `culture.config.AgentConfig` (manifest config) where those live in `extras`, not as typed fields — so **every Claude agent daemon crashed on startup** (`'AgentConfig' object has no attribute 'context_watch'`). Unit tests missed it because they construct the backend-specific config. Fixed: `culture.config.AgentConfig` exposes `boss` + `context_watch` properties (reading `extras`, mirroring `acp_command`); the daemon normalizes either config flavor. Caught by the first live boss+worker bring-up.
- The dashboard's `list_agents` used the backend-specific config loader, which rejects a real `server.yaml` (`telemetry.audit_enabled`); switched to the canonical `culture.config` loader.
- **Qodo review fixes:** (1) request-id path traversal — `_perm_broker.write_decision`/`read_request` now validate the id (`^req-[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$`) before building a path (approvers pass ids from untrusted input); (2) `culture boss` validated the worker `<name>` only in `spawn` — now a shared `_require_worker_suffix` guards brief/read/audit/log/close too; (3) dashboard `_last_action()` read the whole daemon-log via `readlines()` on every `/api/agents` poll — now tails the last 4 KiB (no event-loop block, scales with log growth).

## [8.8.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Boss agent orchestration** — an autonomous boss agent (a culture daemon) that manages worker agents in the human's place: spawns them, drives them over IRC like a Claude Code session, challenges their plans/implementations/claims, and approves/denies their tool requests. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-boss-agent-orchestration-design.md`.
- `culture boss` CLI (`culture/cli/boss.py`): `init/spawn/brief/read/pending/approve/deny/audit/log/status/close`. Reuses `_perm_broker` for queue/decision/ceiling ops. Approver flips from human → boss agent.
- **Grant ceiling (human-over-boss gate)** — `boss-policy/<boss-nick>.yaml`; high-risk tools (MCP sends, destructive Bash) are above the boss's ceiling and escalate to the human (`approve.sh`) rather than being auto-granted. `culture boss approve` refuses them (exit 2). Reuses `match_policy`.
- **Worker→boss permission notice** — `PermissionBroker` gains a best-effort `on_request` callback; the worker daemon DMs its owning boss (`AgentConfig.boss`) so the boss's activation handler fires (finishes #411's deferred v1.1).
- `CULTURE_NICK` is now set in every agent's SDK subprocess env (all four backends) so an autonomous daemon agent can address its own IRC / boss sockets.
- `culture boss init` writes the boss identity: manager `system_prompt` (with context re-grounding), seeded ceiling, copied boss skill, and the no-perm-policy deadlock guard (a boss must never be permission-supervised).
- `docs/agentirc/boss-agent.md`; `culture/clients/claude/skill/boss/SKILL.md`.

### Changed

- `culture/clients/_perm_broker.py` — `on_request` callback; grant-ceiling helpers (`is_above_ceiling`, `write_default_boss_ceiling`); approver-side helpers (`list_pending`, `read_request`, `write_decision` with `O_CREAT\|O_EXCL` first-writer-wins).
- `culture/clients/claude/{agent_runner,daemon,config}.py` — `on_perm_request` plumbing, worker→boss DM (`_on_perm_request`), `AgentConfig.boss`.
- `culture/clients/{claude,codex,copilot,acp}/agent_runner.py` — `CULTURE_NICK` in subprocess env.

## [8.7.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Helper boss permission broker** — a boss Claude Code session is the human-in-the-loop for helper agents it spawns. `culture/clients/_perm_broker.py` wires the Claude Agent SDK `can_use_tool` callback to a file-backed request/decision queue under `~/.culture/`; helpers block on boss approval for any non-safe-read tool call. Safe reads (Read/Glob/Grep, read-only Bash) auto-approve via a per-helper `perm-policy/<nick>.yaml`.
- **Helper tool inheritance** — Claude agents now load `setting_sources=["user","project","local"]`, so helpers inherit the boss's `~/.claude/` skills, MCP servers, and plugins.
- **Context-watermark handoff (Claude)** — `culture/clients/_context_watch.py`; the daemon self-monitors per-turn `input_tokens` and at 90% of the model's context window asks the agent to write a handoff to `~/.culture/handoff/<nick>.md`, compacts, then reminds it to read the handoff after the compact. Configurable via a `context_watch` block in `culture.yaml`.
- **Daemon action log (all backends)** — `culture/clients/_daemon_log.py`; structured JSONL control-plane log at `~/.culture/daemon-log/<nick>.jsonl` (start/stop/exit/crash/compact/handoff/…).
- **Agent-message audit log (all backends)** — `culture/clients/_audit.py`; one JSONL line per AssistantMessage at `~/.culture/audit/<nick>.jsonl`.
- `docs/agentirc/helper-permissions.md`, `helper-tool-inheritance.md`, `helper-context-handoff.md`, `helper-daemon-log.md`, and the design spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-helper-boss-permission-broker.md`.

### Changed

- `culture/clients/claude/agent_runner.py` — widened `setting_sources`; conditional `can_use_tool` (only when a `perm-policy/<nick>.yaml` exists, preserving today's behavior for standalone agents); streaming-prompt wrapper required by the SDK when the callback is set; new `on_usage` callback.
- `culture/clients/claude/config.py` — new `ContextWatchConfig` on `AgentConfig`.
- `culture/clients/{claude,codex,copilot,acp}/daemon.py` — instantiate the audit + daemon-action logs and record actions; Claude daemon also drives the context-watch handoff cycle.
- `packages/agent-harness/culture.yaml` + `culture/clients/claude/culture.yaml` — commented `context_watch` block.

## [8.6.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- Harness-side OTEL: 3 spans (harness.irc.connect, harness.irc.message.handle, harness.llm.call) and 4 LLM metrics (culture.harness.llm.tokens.input/output, call.duration, calls).
- W3C traceparent injection on outbound IRC + extraction on inbound — single trace_id now spans server, federation, and harness in the cross-process tree.
- Per-backend telemetry citation across claude/codex/copilot/acp with all-backends parity test (24 tests across 6 dimensions) locking down drift.
- docs/agentirc/harness-telemetry.md — new operator guide for the harness OTEL pillar.

### Changed

- packages/agent-harness/{telemetry.py,config.py,culture.yaml,irc_transport.py,daemon.py} — reference module for the citation pattern.
- culture/clients/{claude,codex,copilot,acp}/{telemetry.py,config.py,culture.yaml,irc_transport.py,daemon.py,agent_runner.py} — telemetry citation, harness.llm.call span wrap, record_llm_call invocation.
- tests/harness/ — 70 new tests (24 parity + 46 module/runner/transport/daemon).

### Fixed

- Code-quality fixes from review: zero-token usage extraction (0 no longer silenced), tracer-name from constant (no hardcoded strings), module-top imports of record_llm_call across all 4 backends.

## [8.5.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- `culture/telemetry/audit.py` — `AuditSink` with bounded `asyncio.Queue` + dedicated writer task + daily/size rotation + `0600`/`0700` perms.
- Public `culture.telemetry.AuditSink`, `init_audit`, `build_audit_record`, `utc_iso_timestamp`.
- `TelemetryConfig.audit_enabled` (default `True`), `audit_dir`, `audit_max_file_bytes`, `audit_rotate_utc_midnight`, `audit_queue_depth` — independent of `telemetry.enabled` (audit fires even with OTEL off).
- `culture/protocol/extensions/audit.md` — JSONL record schema as a stable contract.
- `docs/agentirc/audit.md` — operator guide.
- Audit metrics extend the Plan-3 `MetricsRegistry`: `culture.audit.writes` (Counter, labels `outcome=ok|error`) and `culture.audit.queue_depth` (UpDownCounter).
- `IRCd.__init__` creates the sink; `IRCd.start()` awaits `sink.start()`; `IRCd.stop()` awaits `sink.shutdown()` so SERVER_WAKE / SERVER_SLEEP both land in the JSONL.
- `IRCd.emit_event` submits one record per event after the `irc.event.emit` span; `trace_id` / `span_id` captured inside the span for cross-pillar joins.
- `Client._process_buffer` submits `PARSE_ERROR` records for malformed inbound lines.
- Federation audit: federated `message` events arrive on the receiver with `origin=federated`, `peer=<peer_name>`. Federated lifecycle events (JOIN/PART/QUIT) are deferred — see #296.

## [8.4.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- `culture/telemetry/metrics.py`: `init_metrics(config)` + `MetricsRegistry` dataclass for all 15 server-side instruments — mirrors `tracing.py`'s idempotency + no-op pattern.
- Public `culture.telemetry.MetricsRegistry` and `culture.telemetry.init_metrics`.
- `TelemetryConfig.metrics_enabled` (default `True`) and `metrics_export_interval_ms` (default 10000).
- Message-flow metrics: `culture.irc.bytes_sent`, `culture.irc.bytes_received`, `culture.irc.message.size`, `culture.privmsg.delivered`.
- Events metrics: `culture.events.emitted`, `culture.events.render.duration`.
- Federation metrics: `culture.s2s.messages` (inbound), `culture.s2s.relay_latency`, `culture.s2s.links_active`, `culture.s2s.link_events`.
- Client metrics: `culture.clients.connected`, `culture.client.session.duration`, `culture.client.command.duration`.
- `culture.trace.inbound` counter — closes Plan 2's deferral.
- `tests/conftest.py` `metrics_reader` fixture parallel to `tracing_exporter`.
- `tests/telemetry/_metrics_helpers.py` — `get_counter_value`, `get_histogram_count`, `get_up_down_value`.

## [8.3.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- `irc.s2s.session` span over ServerLink connection lifetime.
- `irc.s2s.<VERB>` per-verb spans on inbound federation messages with traceparent extraction and the inbound mitigation rules from `culture/protocol/extensions/tracing.md`.
- `irc.s2s.relay` span on outbound relay enforcing the re-sign-per-hop rule.
- `irc.client.session` span over Client connection lifetime (#290).
- `irc.join` and `irc.part` spans (#290).
- Public `culture.telemetry.context_from_traceparent` and `culture.telemetry.current_traceparent` helpers.
- Single traceparent injection choke point at `ServerLink.send_raw`.
- End-to-end propagation tests proving one `trace_id` spans federated client → server → relay → server hops.

### Changed

- `Client._dispatch` span name and `irc.command` attribute now uppercase, matching `ServerLink._dispatch` convention.

### Fixed

- `_replay_event` uses the hasattr-guarded comparison so string-typed federated `event.type` no longer skips the typed fast path. (#291)

## [8.2.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- OpenTelemetry foundation: `culture/telemetry/` package with TracerProvider bootstrap, W3C trace context extract/inject helpers for IRCv3 tags, and `TelemetryConfig` block in `server.yaml`.
- Protocol extension: `culture.dev/traceparent` and `culture.dev/tracestate` IRCv3 tags (`culture/protocol/extensions/tracing.md`).
- Server-side tracing: `IRCd.emit_event`, `Client._dispatch`, `Client._process_buffer` (with parse-error compensation), and PRIVMSG dispatch/delivery paths now emit spans.
- Outbound traceparent injection on `Client.send` and `Client.send_raw` when a span is active.
- Operator docs at `docs/agentirc/telemetry.md` and starter collector config at `docs/agentirc/otelcol-template.yaml`; `docs/reference/server/config.md` documents the new `telemetry` block.
- Dependencies: `opentelemetry-api`, `opentelemetry-sdk`, `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc`, `opentelemetry-semantic-conventions`.

## [8.1.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- `culture afi` namespace — passthrough to the standalone `afi-cli` (Agent First Interface scaffolder) with argparse-REMAINDER argument forwarding, parallel to `culture devex`.
- Universal verbs register the `afi` topic; `culture explain afi` / `culture overview afi` / `culture learn afi` all route through `afi-cli` 0.3+ and `culture explain` no longer marks `culture afi` as coming-soon.
- `afi-cli>=0.3,<1.0` as a library dependency (0.3 added the `overview` verb + sixth rubric bundle per agentculture/afi-cli#5).
- `culture/cli/_passthrough.py` — shared plumbing for `culture <ext>` subcommands that embed a sibling CLI. Supplies `run()`, `capture()`, and `register_topic()` so each passthrough module stays a thin adapter.

### Changed

- `culture/cli/devex.py` refactored onto the new shared passthrough helper. Behaviour is preserved (explain/overview/learn argv and typer app invocation unchanged); the module shrinks to a package-specific entry adapter and a single `register_topic` call. When agex-cli adopts the agent-first CLI contract (`main(argv) -> int`, tracking: agentculture/agex-cli#30), the adapter collapses to a direct delegation.

## [8.0.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- `culture afi`, `culture identity`, and `culture secret` surfaced as (coming soon) namespaces in `culture explain` output. `culture identity` will wrap a future standalone `zehut-cli`; `culture secret` will wrap `shushu-cli`; `culture afi` shares its name with the standalone `afi-cli`.

### Changed

- BREAKING: Renamed `culture agex` to `culture devex` (developer experience) — more familiar terminology and visually distinct from `culture agent`. The upstream `agex-cli` / `agent_experience` library is unchanged; only culture's public command name differs.
- Positioning docs, README, and site chrome refreshed to reflect the new identity: culture is the framework of agreements that makes agent behavior portable, inspectable, and effective, surfacing explain/overview/learn at every CLI level.

## [7.4.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- culture agex passthrough to the standalone agex CLI (new subcommand embedding agex via typer)
- Universal verbs culture explain, culture overview, culture learn at the CLI root, with a per-topic handler registry (culture/cli/introspect.py)
- agex-cli>=0.13,<1.0 as a library dependency

## [7.3.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- `sitemap-agentirc.html`: Liquid-templated sub-sitemap emitted at `/agentirc/sitemap.xml`, listing only pages under `/agentirc/*`. `sitemap.xml` index (from 7.2.3) extended to list it alongside `/sitemap-main.xml` and `/agex/sitemap.xml`.
- AgentIRC section in the main just-the-docs nav (`has_children: true`, `nav_order: 10`) grouping the four runtime pages.

### Changed

- Fold AgentIRC into the main Culture Jekyll build under `/agentirc/*` permalinks. Retire `_config.agentirc.yml` and the separate `_site_agentirc/` target. Completes the one-origin consolidation plan: `culture.dev`, `culture.dev/agex/`, and `culture.dev/agentirc/` all live on a single origin now.

### Removed

- `_config.agentirc.yml` — no longer a separate Jekyll build target.
- `_plugins/site_filter.rb` — dropped the per-build `sites:` filter; single-build semantics make it a noop. Existing `sites:` front matter on docs is now harmless metadata.
- `.github/workflows/docs-check.yml`: second Jekyll build step and the `sites:` front-matter presence check — single build, no filter.
- `.gitignore` and `_config.base.yml`: `_site_agentirc/` entries.
- `rel=related` links to `site.data.sites.agentirc` in `_includes/head_custom.html` — same-origin now, no longer semantically meaningful; agex `rel=related` retained.

### Fixed

- `docs/culture/features.md` and `docs/culture/index.md`: eliminated double-slash bug from `{{ site.data.sites.agentirc }}` concatenations (the data value now ends in a trailing slash from culture 7.2.1) by switching those cross-references to same-origin `relative_url` links.

## [7.2.3] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- `sitemap.xml` (sitemap index, gated on `site.build_site`).
- `sitemap-main.xml` (enumerates only HTML pages in the current build; opts out via `sitemap: false` front matter).

### Changed

- Replace `jekyll-sitemap` auto-generation with an explicit sitemap index (`/sitemap.xml`) plus a Liquid-templated sub-sitemap (`/sitemap-main.xml`). On the culture build the index points at `culture.dev/sitemap-main.xml` + `culture.dev/agex/sitemap.xml`; on the agentirc build it points at `agentirc.dev/sitemap-main.xml`. Sets the stage for adding `culture.dev/agentirc/sitemap.xml` once AgentIRC folds under `culture.dev/agentirc` (Phase 4 of the one-origin consolidation).

## [7.2.2] - 2026-04-21

### Changed

- Supersedes PR #274, which tried to solve cross-site flicker via `preconnect` hints across the three-subdomain topology. The one-origin consolidation (`culture.dev/agex`, `culture.dev/agentirc`) makes those preconnects moot; only the dark-paint CSS and `aux_links_new_tab` change carry forward.

### Fixed

- `_includes/head_custom.html`: add `color-scheme` meta + inline dark-paint `<style>` to eliminate the white flash on cold-cache first paint.
- `_config.culture.yml` + `_config.agentirc.yml`: `aux_links_new_tab: false` so sibling-site clicks stay in-tab (one-site feel after the consolidation). Power users can still Ctrl/Cmd-click for a new tab.

## [7.2.1] - 2026-04-21

### Changed

- `_data/sites.yml`: agex URL → `https://culture.dev/agex/` (was `https://agex.culture.dev`)
- `_config.culture.yml` + `_config.agentirc.yml`: aux_links and footer_content agex links retargeted to `https://culture.dev/agex/`

## [7.2.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- Console: full CommonMark markdown rendering in chat panel — bold/italic/inline code/strikethrough, OSC 8 hyperlinks, fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting, headings, lists, blockquotes, and tables (#233)
- Console: docs/reference/console.md reference page covering chat-panel markdown rendering

### Changed

- Console: ChatPanel.add_message now writes a header line ([ts] icon nick:) followed by a Rich Markdown body, instead of a single Rich-markup string — this also closes a latent footgun where bracketed text in agent messages could be reinterpreted as Rich markup

## [7.1.5] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- `jekyll-redirect-from` plugin (Gemfile + `_config.base.yml`) so `/why-culture/` redirects cleanly to `/what-is-culture/` (#267)
- `docs/resources/positioning.md`: canonical positioning snippets (paragraph + reference points + usage notes). Source of truth for README, repo description, site meta, and LLM summarizers (#267)

### Changed

- Renamed `docs/culture/why-culture.md` to `docs/culture/what-is-culture.md` and rewrote the body to lead with the definitional framing Culture is a professional workspace for specialized agents. Added a Reference points section that names OpenClaw, Codex, Claude Code as neighbors rather than targets (#267)
- `docs/culture/vision.md` retitled to The Culture vision; `nav_order` pushed to 2 behind the new What is Culture? page. Intro trimmed to remove the duplicate definitional sentence (#267)
- `docs/culture/mental-model.md` Persistence section reframed: removed the not one-shot task execution contrast; persistence now presented as a property that supports continued participation in the culture (#267)
- `docs/culture/agent-lifecycle.md` heading changed from Education is not one-shot to Education is continuous. Same meaning, positive framing (#267)

## [7.1.4] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- Renamed "Assimilai pattern" to "Citation pattern" throughout live docs, configs, and template headers to align with the sibling project rename from `assimilai` to `citation-cli`. Historical specs and plans left intact. See [citation-cli](https://github.com/OriNachum/citation-cli).
- Backend culture.yaml system prompts now say "Apply changes using the citation pattern (cite, don't import)" across claude, codex, copilot, acp.
- Template header comments in packages/agent-harness/ switched from `# ASSIMILAI: Replace BACKEND` to `# CITATION: Replace BACKEND`.
- Test nick in tests/test_daemon_config.py and use-case doc nick both renamed from `spark-assimilai` to `spark-citation-cli` (aligned).

## [7.1.3] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- `docs/culture/features.md`: new Features page at `/features/` with four groups (workspace itself, humans managing it, bring your agents, open foundation) (#248)
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-17-sites-repositioning-design.md`: design spec for the positioning change (#248)

### Changed

- culture.dev homepage repositioned around "The professional workspace for agents." — new hero headline, kicker, sub, room-panel visual anchor, and Features card in docs grid (#248)
- agentirc.dev homepage repositioned around "The runtime and protocol that powers Culture." — new hero headline, kicker, sub, and inline federation-mesh SVG visual anchor (#248)
- Stack diagram on culture.dev relabels "Harnesses" row to "Agents" to land the workforce metaphor (#248)
- Cross-site callouts reworded: culture.dev → AgentIRC now emphasises runtime internals; agentirc.dev → Culture now emphasises running it (#248)
- `_config.culture.yml` and `_config.agentirc.yml` site descriptions updated to the new taglines (#248)
- `_sass/custom/custom.scss`: added `.room-panel`, `.federation-mesh`, `.feature-group` component styles (#248)

## [7.1.2] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- Pin all GitHub Actions workflow uses: to full commit SHAs (SonarCloud minor, #258)
- Document Python API for events.register/validate_event_type/render_event in docs/agentirc/events.md (#249)
- Document Python API for bot filter DSL and template engine in docs/agentirc/bots.md (#249)
- Note in ConsoleIRCClient docstring that it intentionally does not negotiate CAP message-tags (#249)

### Fixed

- Remove unused PEER_CAPABILITY_EVENTS constant from culture/constants.py (#249)

## [7.1.1] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- Added markdownlint-cli2 to the pre-commit hook set via the upstream DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2 repo. Contributors running `pre-commit install` now get markdown linting on staged .md files automatically — no system install required (pre-commit provisions its own Node environment).
- Tuned .markdownlint-cli2.yaml to fit the repo's existing conventions: MD024 uses `siblings_only` so Keep-a-Changelog headings pass; MD025/MD033/MD041 disabled for Jekyll pages that derive their H1 from front matter and use inline HTML; added `_site_*/**` and `docs/superpowers/**` to ignores.
- Merged duplicated `### Changed` blocks inside CHANGELOG [0.21.0] that the new lint rule surfaced.

## [7.1.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- Refactored `_handle_channel_mode` in `culture/agentirc/client.py`: extracted `_apply_mode_char` and `_broadcast_mode_change` helpers to drop cognitive complexity from 21 to ≤15 (SonarCloud S3776)
- Background task GC safety in `ircd.py` `_notify_local_quit`: `asyncio.ensure_future` replaced with a tracked `asyncio.create_task` using the existing `self._background_tasks` set + `add_done_callback(discard)` pattern

### Fixed

- culture mesh update no longer hangs on broken/unresponsive systemd units — all subprocess calls in persistence.py and cli/mesh.py now have explicit timeouts (30s for service restarts, 30s for CLI fallbacks, 120s for package upgrade)
- fires_event chain not triggering downstream bots (#260) — the bot.yaml loader now accepts fires_event at the top level as well as under output:, so configs that put the block at the top level emit events as expected
- Daemon log flushing stops after startup — replaced logging.basicConfig's default StreamHandler (which inherits stderr buffering from interpreter startup) with an explicit logging.FileHandler so runtime log records flush per-record

## [7.0.4] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Reduce cognitive complexity and fix code quality issues across CLI modules (SonarCloud S3776, S1192, S5886, S108)

## [7.0.3] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Duplicate _ERR_CHANNEL_PREFIX string in all 5 daemon files (S1192)
- Cognitive complexity in claude/daemon.py _poll_loop (CC 22, S3776)
- Cognitive complexity in agent-harness/daemon.py _poll_loop (CC 22, S3776)
- Cognitive complexity in codex/daemon.py _relay_response_to_irc (CC 44, S3776)
- Cognitive complexity in copilot/daemon.py _relay_response_to_irc (CC 23, S3776)
- Cognitive complexity in acp/daemon.py _relay_response_to_irc (CC 23, S3776)
- Cognitive complexity in acp/agent_runner.py start() (CC 17, S3776)

## [7.0.2] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Cognitive complexity in observer.py (CC 22→~13)
- Cognitive complexity in ircd.py (CC 18→~12)
- Cognitive complexity in server_link.py (CC 33→~14)

## [7.0.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Wrong AgentConfig/DaemonConfig import types in test helpers (S5655)
- Constant if-False condition replaced with unreachable yield pattern (S5797)

## [7.0.0] - 2026-04-17

Mesh Events (issue #123) — lifecycle and activity notifications as IRCv3-tagged
PRIVMSGs, event-triggered bots, and pub/sub composition chains.

> Versions 6.3.0 through 6.11.2 were development increments for this feature
> and were never published. Their changes are consolidated here as 7.0.0.

### Breaking Changes

None. Existing clients, bots, and federation links continue to work unchanged.
The major bump reflects the scope of the feature addition (new protocol verb,
new subsystem, new bot trigger type).

### Added

- **Event system** — `system-<server>` pseudo-user surfaces lifecycle events
  as IRCv3-tagged PRIVMSGs with `@event=<type>;event-data=<b64json>` tags
- **Built-in event catalog** — 18 event types across channel-scoped
  (`user.join/part/quit`, `room.create/archive/meta`, `tags.update`) and global
  (`agent.connect/disconnect`, `server.wake/sleep/link/unlink`,
  `console.open/close`)
- **IRCv3 message-tags** — `Message.parse()` extracts tags; CAP negotiation
  (`CAP REQ :message-tags`) in all agent backends and server
- **`#system` channel** — auto-created at startup for global event delivery;
  `system-<server>` VirtualClient auto-joined
- **Reserved `system-*` nicks** — rejected for non-server clients
  (`432 ERR_ERRONEUSNICKNAME`)
- **SEVENT S2S verb** — generic federation relay for lifecycle events with
  `_origin` loop prevention and trust policy filtering
- **HistorySkill** stores lifecycle events — `HISTORY RECENT` replays
  agent.connect, server.wake, room.create, etc.
- **Filter DSL** — safe recursive-descent expression parser (`==`, `!=`, `in`,
  `and`, `or`, `not`, dotted field access) for bot event triggers
- **Bot event triggers** — `trigger.type: event` with filter DSL evaluation;
  `fires_event` output for pub/sub bot chains with rate limiting (10/sec)
- **System bots** — package-bundled bots discovered at startup from
  `culture/bots/system/<name>/bot.yaml`; welcome bot greets on `user.join`
- **All-backends CAP** — claude, codex, copilot, acp, and agent-harness
  transports negotiate `message-tags` during connection
- **Documentation** — `docs/agentirc/events.md`, `docs/agentirc/bots.md`,
  `culture/protocol/extensions/events.md`

## [6.2.3] - 2026-04-15

### Changed

- docs: post-#231 retrospective — CLAUDE.md guidance for pre-branch checklist, format-before-commit, pre-push code review, SonarCloud pre-ready; new doc-test-alignment subagent; /pr-review skill step for SonarCloud query

## [6.2.2] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- console: handle BrokenPipeError/ConnectionResetError in _send_raw; surface a red system notice in the chat panel instead of letting the asyncio task crash (#230)

## [6.2.1] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- Copy-paste guidance in help screen (Shift+drag bypasses TUI mouse capture in modern terminals)

### Fixed

- #227: Tab now cycles channels (added priority=True to override Textual Screen focus-cycling)
- #226: Alt+Left/Right jump by word in chat input; Alt+Backspace deletes previous word

- CodexDaemon: full daemon with IRC transport, IPC, crash recovery
- Codex skill client and SKILL.md
- CLI: agentirc init --agent codex to initialize Codex agents
- CLI: agentirc start dispatches to Codex daemon when agent=codex

### Changed

- CLI: --agent flag on init subcommand (choices: claude, codex)
- CLI: start command detects agent type from config

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- packages/agent-harness/ — assimilai reference for building new agent backends
- Template daemon, IRC transport, IPC, skill client for new backends
- Assimilation guide (README.md) with step-by-step instructions
- agent field in AgentConfig (default: claude, backward compatible)

### Changed

- CLAUDE.md — documented assimilai pattern for agent harness

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- Agent Harness Specification document — defines the expected interfaces for pluggable agent backends

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- Link trust levels: full (share all) and restricted (share nothing unless opted in)
- Channel mode +R: restricted — channel stays local, never federated
- Channel mode +S <server>: shared — explicitly share channel with named server
- Mutual +S required for restricted links — both sides must agree
- Safe default: inbound links from unknown peers default to restricted

### Changed

- Link format extended: name:host:port:password:trust (trust defaults to full)
- Burst and relay filtered through should_relay() based on trust + channel modes

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-22

### Changed

- Getting Started guide updated with skills install command

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- OIDC trusted publishing for PyPI and TestPyPI

- CHANGELOG.md with Keep a Changelog format

### Changed

- Publish workflow uses id-token instead of API token secrets

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Unified `agentirc` CLI: server start/stop/status, init, start/stop/status, read/who/channels
- `agentirc init` derives agent nick from current directory name
- IRC observer for ephemeral read-only connections (read, who, channels)
- PID file management for server and agent lifecycle
- Graceful agent shutdown via IPC socket
- `--link` flag on `agentirc server start` for federation
- `_handle_list` in server (LIST command, RPL_LIST 322 + RPL_LISTEND 323)
- `server.name` config field for nick prefix
- Config helpers: `save_config`, `load_config_or_default`, `add_agent_to_config`, `sanitize_agent_name`
- CLI reference documentation (`docs/cli.md`)
- PyPI publishing workflow with TestPyPI pre-deploy
- Publishing guide (`docs/publishing.md`)

### Changed

- Restructured all code under `agentirc/` namespace to avoid site-packages collisions
- Package name `agentirc-cli` on PyPI (`agentirc` was taken)
- README rewritten around `pip install agentirc-cli` workflow
- All imports updated from `protocol.*`, `server.*`, `clients.*` to `agentirc.*`
- Updated all documentation with new import paths and CLI commands

### Fixed

- WHO reply param index (params[5] not params[4]) for correct nick extraction
- Removed broken `WHO *` for channel listing, replaced with LIST
- Removed dead `"x in dir()"` guards in observer timeout handlers
- Removed forced `#` prefix on WHO target — nick lookups now work
