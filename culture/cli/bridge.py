"""``culture bridge`` — start / stop / status the per-nick IRC bridge.

The bridge is the transport half of "CC IS the boss" (v9.0.0-rc.1). A
CC session opens an IPC socket to a bridge daemon which holds the
boss's IRC presence; CC is the brain, the bridge is the wire.

Subcommands:

* ``culture bridge start <nick> [--channels …] [--foreground]`` —
  spawn a bridge daemon for *nick*. By default it detaches into the
  background, writes ``~/.culture/run/bridge-<nick>.pid``, and exits 0
  once the child has been launched (does not wait for the bridge to
  reach the IRC server).
* ``culture bridge stop <nick>`` — SIGTERM the recorded PID and
  remove the PID file. Idempotent: a missing PID file or a dead
  process is reported but not a fatal error.
* ``culture bridge status`` — list every recorded PID file under
  ``~/.culture/run/bridge-*.pid`` with a live / stale label.

Implementation: thin wrapper around
``python -m culture.clients.bridge``. The actual daemon lives in
``culture/clients/bridge/__main__.py``; this CLI just deals with PID
files and background detach.
